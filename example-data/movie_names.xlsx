JASMINE:,,What?
ALADDIN:,,Abu,says,that--uh--that's,not,fair.

ORCHESTRA,plays.

All,eyes,turn,to,the,GLASS,DOORS,OF,TWO,ELEVADORS,which
descend,grandly,on,either,side,of,a,beautiful,staircase.
Through,the,glass,doors,we,see,TATIANA,the,Dowager
Empress,60,imperious,and,bedecked,with,jewels,she,is
seemingly,unapproachable.,TSAR,NICHOLAS,and,his,SON,are
with,her.,In,the,other,elevador,ALEXANDRA,and,her

ribbon,falls,out,of,her,hair,and,down,her,back,
Anastasia,kicks,it,to,Sonya,without,breaking,stride.

,,,,,,,,Did,you,see,that?,How,he,gave,you

,,,,,,,,he's,got,something,against,workers.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,WEAVER

,,,,,,,,,,,,,WEAVER
,,,,,,,,Yeah,but,you,get,to,spend,all,day

,,,We,can,see,that,Weaver,is,eyeing,a,nearby,table,of,""Worker

,,,INT.,ANT,BAR,ENTRANCE,-,NIGHT

,,,Princess,Bala,is,peering,in,at,the,entrance,to,the,ant,bar,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,BARKER
,,,,,,,,,,,(on,loudspeaker)
,,,,,,,,Okay,folks.,It's,six-fifteen,and
,,,,,,,,that,means,it's,time,to,dance.

,,,Every,ant,gets,up,to,dance.,Weaver,turns,to,Z.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,WEAVER

,,,all,the,ants,already,know,the,steps.,Everyone,dances,in

,,,The,handmaidens,are,appalled.,Bala,whirls,away,from,them,
,,,sets,her,sights,and,searches,the,crowd,--,zeroing,in,on,--

,,,Z,who's,watching,the,other,ants,dance.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,Z
,,,,,,,,What,a,bunch,of,losers.,Mindless
,,,,,,,,zombies,capitulating,to,an,oppressive

,,,,,,,,,,,,,BALA
,,,,,,,,Wanna,dance?

,,,Bala's,standing,right,there.,Z,is,instantly,smitten.

,,,Z,and,Bala,step,onto,the,dance,floor,with,the,rest,of,the

,,,,,,,,,,,,,Z
,,,,,,,,Now,let's,see,I,--,it's,been,a

,,,,,,,,,,,,,Z
,,,,,,,,Here,I'll,lead.

,,,Z,starts,doing,his,own,individual,dance.,With,a,suave
,,,expression,on,his,face,he,leads,Bala,in,a,helter-skelter
,,,mixture-of,Tango,Charleston,and,hand-jive.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,BALA
,,,,,,,,Are,you,sure,this,is,a,real,dance?

,,,,,,,,,,,,,Z
,,,,,,,,Well,actually,uh,--,I'm,sort,of
,,,,,,,,making,it,up,--

,,,,,,,,,,,,,BALA
,,,,,,,,,,,(surprised)
,,,,,,,,Really?

,,,,,,,,,,,,,Z
,,,,,,,,Why,should,everyone,dance,the,same

,,,,,,,,,,,,,BALA
,,,,,,,,You're,right!

,,,,,,,,,,,,,Z
,,,,,,,,,,,(surprised)
,,,,,,,,You,--,you,think,I'm,right?

,,,,,,,,Why,can't,I,just,do,whatever,I,want

,,,,,,,,,,,,,SOLDIER
,,,,,,,,Hey!,Watch,your,step,worker.

                                              SNATCHER
                                       (NODS)
                    They're no doubt picking their
                    teeth with his adorable baby bones
                    by now!
                         
                                             LORD PORTLEY-RIND
                    A horrible tragedy.
                        (beat, flippant)
                    Let's deal with it in the morning!
                         
          Portley-Rind turns to go.
                         
                                SNATCHER (O.S.)
                    STOP!
                         
          The Butler closes the door, but Snatcher shoves his foot in
          the way.
                         
                                             SNATCHER (CONT'D)

                    Oh, oof! That's not the worst of
                    it! Next they'll come after...
                                                                      3.
                         
                         
          The Butler shoves at the door, slapping and shoving
          Snatcher's face until the door slams shut. Snatcher opens the
          mail slot and yells through it.
                         
                                             SNATCHER (CONT'D)

          Portley-Rind suddenly flings open the doors, stares wide eyed
          at Snatcher. He is crouched on the ground near the mail
          slot.
                         
                                             LORD PORTLEY-RIND
                    You're the town exterminator. I'll
                    pay whatever it takes.
                         
          Snatcher stands slowly.
                         
                                             SNATCHER
                    Oh, I don't want money.
                         
          He steps into the house and into the light, REVEALING his
          greedy face for the first time. He smiles an oily smile.
                         
                                             SNATCHER (CONT'D)
                    I want one of those.
                         
          Snatcher points to the WHITE HAT on Portley-Rind's head. Lord
          Portley-Rind grabs his hat protectively.
                         
                                             LORD PORTLEY-RIND
                    A White Hat? You?! Absurd!
                         
          Snatcher turns to leave, moving towards the damp Market
          Square.
                         
                                             SNATCHER
                    Alright then. But prepare to say
                    bye bye to your Brie. Cheerio to
                    your Cheddar. Goodbye to your...
                         
          Portley-Rind's resolve disappears. He raises his hand as if
          to stop Snatcher from leaving.
                                                                     4.

                    With proof!
                         
          Snatcher stops halfway down the stairs in the pouring rain,
          his back still turned to Portley-Rind.

          WIDE VIEW OF CHEESEBRIDGE, a steep hill-town that looms over
          the countryside. A jumble of roofs, a tangle of twisting
          alleys, and perched at the summit, the imposing Cheese Guild
          Hall. The last rays of the setting sun disappear.
                         
          EXT. CHEESEBRIDGE STREETS
                         
          --a deep voice echoes out of a scratchy MEGAPHONE.
                         
                              SNATCHER (O.S.)
                    Hear ye! Hear ye! Good citizens of
                    Cheesebridge, the curfew is in
                    force. Don't dawdle or the beasts
                    will tear you limb from limb!
                         
          CLOSE ON: A FABRIC BANNER reading ""BOXTROLL EXTERMINATORS"".
                         
          The banner hangs on a strange rattletrap TRUCK that winds its
          way up the city streets. Sinister looking men in BLOOD RED
          TOP HATS hang onto the running boards. The most sinister of
          them all, Snatcher, rides on the roof.
                                                                   5.

                    rivers of blood and mountains of
                    bones.
                         
          As the truck passes, PEDESTRIANS gasp and hurry into their
          houses, heeding the amplified warning. A CHEESEMONGER at The
          Cheesery pulls his FOLDING SIGN from the sidewalk and hurries
          inside. A COUPLE stops mid-conversation and heads indoors. A
          MAN CARRYING A CRATE brings his load into his shop,
          abandoning the crate sitting at the curb. Two FEMALE
          TOWNSFOLK head off down the street.
                         
          CLOSE ON: Archibald Snatcher as the truck rounds a corner.
          He holds a MEGAPHONE TUBE to his mouth and orates as he zeros
          in on a BOY playing ball in the street.
                         
                                             SNATCHER (CONT'D)

                    the Trubshaw Baby?
                         
          The boy watches the truck as it passes, curiosity changing to
          horror.
                         
                                             SNATCHER (CONT'D)
                    Dragged underground and feasted
                    upon one year ago this very night?!
                         
          The terrified boy shakes his head and GASPS as he is yanked
          inside by his MOTHER. His BALL bounces out of his hands and
          rolls across the cobbles.
                         
                                             SNATCHER (CONT'D)

          One man grabs his DOOR KNOCKER and bolts inside.
                         
          Another man grabs his MAILBOX.
                         
          Another a BARBER POLE.
                         
          With a terrified look the last man peers out of the peep hole
          in his door, then slams it shut.

          EXT CHEESEBRIDGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
                         
          The wind blows trash down the empty streets. Snatcher's
          vehicle, rattling from its boiler, prowls past with Snatcher
          still calling out his warning until the sound fades in the
          distance.
                         
                              SNATCHER (O.S.)
                    Beware the bloodthirsty monsters!
                    They'll fry your eyes, gnaw on your
                    knees, gobble your gizzards...
                    Beware! BEWARE!
                         
          After Snatcher's truck has passed the CAMERA lands on: A
          MANHOLE. Carved in the heavy iron cover is a warning: ""HERE
          BE MONSTERS"".
                         
          A LONG BEAT OF SILENCE. The manhole cover slowly twists and
          lifts, a pudgy blue hand emerges. Two pairs of yellow,
          glowing eyes peer out. The creatures talk in expressive but
          unintelligible GURGLES. Down the street, two more manhole
          covers lift.
                         
          In pairs and in gangs, these BOXTROLLS -- so called for the
          cardboard boxes they wear -- emerge from the sewers and
          scurry through the streets of the besieged town. Their long,
          forboding SHADOWS creep across walls plastered with posters
          that read: ""CHEESEBRIDGE: A GOUDA PLACE TO LIVE"", ""REDHATS -
          BOXTROLL EXTERMINATORS"".
                         
          We watch them scurry through streets and alleyways, gurgling
          quiet directions to each other. They move swiftly and travel
          in packs. We see a lone boxtroll jump and pull himself in to
          his box as a DOG BARKS. He pops back out of his box and moves
          along quickly.
                         
          CLOSE ON: what appears to be a LARGE BOXTROLL MONSTER peering
          around the corner of a moonlight street. Its glowing eyes
          turn toward the camera as it sways slowly. Five more pairs of
          eyes light up within the large, boxy shadow and SIX BOXTROLLS
          separate from the mass, popping off to run their errands
          while the coast is clear.
                         
          BIRDS EYE VIEW: Groups of two and three boxtrolls snake their
          way down streets, skirting carefully around areas lit by
          street lamps.
                         
          In a small lane, groups of boxtrolls stop to collect
          mechanical stuff. They work together, using their boxes as
          tools and props.
                         
          SIX BOXTROLLS stack up in the background to steal a SHOP
          SIGN, while THREE BOXTROLLS cooperatively steal the WHEEL
          from a WOODEN CART.
                                                                          7.
                         
                         
          One boxtroll uses his box to prop up a       corner while the other
          two release the wheel from the axle. A       LONE BOXTROLL crosses
          the frame to see what treasures he may       find in a trash bin;
          as he knocks it over with a CLANG, TWO       BOXTROLLS scurry past
          and stack together, stealing the HOUSE       NUMBER from the front
          of a brownstone.
                         
          CLOSE ON: the boxtrolls' booty - the shiny brass number `2',
          the shop sign for `TIMELESS TIMEPIECES', the wheel that rolls
          along between two boxtrolls.
                         
          Six other boxtrolls on the hunt stack together against a
          fence. We watch as one boxtroll makes it over the top,
          cooperatively pulling the others into the alley behind him.

          EXT. CHASE ALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          CLOSE ON: The inside of a trash can as the lid is removed.
          Two BOXTROLL HANDS wriggle into view over the rubbish, fill
          of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, an APPLE CORE, a BANANA PEEL, and a
          FISH CARCASS. The boxtroll gurgles ""EWW"" and ""BLECH"" sounds
          as he moves these unwanted items aside. He gurgles with joy
          when a bit of brass is revealed.
                         
          FISH, a nervous 4-foot tall, wonky-toothed, pointy-eared,
          gangly-limbed boxtroll, pulls an old broken ALARM CLOCK from
          the trash barrel. He is in a large alley, filled with old
          boxes, crates, broken items and tarps strewn about.
                         
          Fish stares curiously at the object, turning it over in his
          hands and holding it to his ear, listening. He shakes the
          clock and hears loose gears RATTLE.
                         
                                                   FISH
                           Hmm...
                         
          Fish opens the clock face        and gurgles, intently toying with
          the mechanical interior.         After a moment, the clock begins to
          TICK with activity. Fish         gurgles excitedly and closes the
          clock face, holding it to        his ear to listen to the rhythmic
          ticking.
                         
                                             FISH (CONT'D)
                    (GURGLES) Oh yeah...
                         
          Fish's eyes go wide as the clock's alarm RINGS, attracting
          the attention of an uglier, 2-foot-2 boxtroll.
                         
                                                   SHOE
                    Huh?
                                                                      8.
                         
                         
          As Fish stands proudly admiring the sound of his ringing
          alarm clock, SHOE bounces around his feet.
                         
                                             SHOE (CONT'D)
                    (GURGLES) Gimme that!
                         
          Shoe, short and feisty, grabs the alarm clock from Fish and
          scampers away with it. Fish watches as Shoe climbs a stack of
          crates and hisses back at him, sniffing at his new prize.
          Fish scowls at Shoe and returns to the rubbish pile, shaking
          his head and muttering.
                         
          Behind him a half-dozen boxtrolls methodically pick through
          an assortment of trash barrels and old boxes. It's like a
          troop of monkeys at the dump. They find mechanical stuff,
          inspect it, and then either drop it into their box to keep or
          toss it back into the trash.
                         
          A filthy TEDDY BEAR WITH A MUSICAL KEY is discarded by
          another boxtroll, landing with a THUNK and A FEW TINNY
          MUSICAL NOTES. Fish turns excitedly.
                         
                                             FISH
                                       (CURIOUS)
                    Ohhhh...
                         
          He picks up the teddy bear and cranks a key in its back as
          Shoe toys with the stolen alarm clock. The teddy bear plays
          MUSIC. Fish gurgles along to the tune and bobs his head,
          enjoying the moment.
                         
          Again, Shoe notices Fish has found something interesting. He
          shoves the alarm clock into his box, stealthily sneaks up on
          Fish and makes a grab for the teddy bear! Fish refuses to let
          go and they squabble over it. Suddenly all the boxtrolls snap
          to attention, their ears alert--
                         
                         
          EXT. CHASE ALLEY
                         
          The creepy RATTLING SOUNDS of the Redhats' truck returns.
                         
          All the boxtrolls hide in their boxes. The ""camouflage""
          works. Their boxes fit in perfectly with the trash barrels
          and packing crates.
                         
          The rattling comes closer... closer... then STOPS.
                         
          BAM! HEADLIGHTS light up the alley.
                         
          Three men dismount from the truck and cast long shadows
          across the alley and all of the boxes: the giant MR. TROUT,
          the beanpole thin MR. PICKLES, and the short, pit bull MR.
          GRISTLE.
                                                                      9.
                         
                         
          The boxtrolls don't run -- they just KEEP HIDING IN THEIR
          BOXES.
                         
                                 SNATCHER (O.S.)
                    GENTLEMEN!
                         
          Snatcher spreads his arms theatrically and wades into the
          garbage-strewn alley.
                         
                                             SNATCHER (CONT'D)
                    Look at all these boxes left lying
                    about. How curious, how peculiar. I
                    do believe... evil is afoot.
                         
          Gristle chuckles and breaks into a psychotic grin.
                         
                              MR. GRISTLE
                                       (COLD BLOODED)
                    HAHAHA. FOOT.
                         
                                 MR. PICKLES
                    Huh.
                         
          Fish peeks out of his box momentarily, then retreats when he
          sees the Redhats advancing into the alley.
                         
          Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles absentmindedly check boxes for
          boxtrolls, but Mr. Gristle methodically stomps and smashes
          every box he can. When he finds a box with a boxtroll, he
          uses a CRICKET BAT to WHACK it back to the others to load
          onto the truck.
                         
                              MR. PICKLES (CONT'D)
                    You ever seen someone's foot be
                    evil, Mr. Trout?
                         
                              MR. TROUT
                    I believe the boss meant evil is
                    nearby, Mr. Pickles.
                         
                              MR. PICKLES
                    My foot had a pretty nasty bunion
                    once. I wouldn't say the foot
                    itself was evil.
                         
                              MR. TROUT
                    No, it's just a fancy-man's word
                    for vicinity.
                         
                              MR. PICKLES
                    Wrinkly ol' bunion looked like my
                    grandmum. Had to saw her off. The
                    bunion, not my grandmum.
                                                                  10.
                         
                         
          Mr. Gristle spots a shivering box and positions himself over
          it, cricket bat in hand.
                         
                               MR. GRISTLE
                    Ah, yes.   FOOT!
                         
          WHACK! Gristle kicks the box, and it flies toward Mr. Pickles
          and Mr. Trout.
                         
                              MR. TROUT
                    There's one!
                         
          Mr. Pickles scoops it up in a dog catcher's net.
                         
                              MR. PICKLES
                    Come on, ya squirmy monster. Your
                    days of evil-doin' are over.
                         
          Mr. Gristle finds another shivering box. He swings his bat.
                         
                               MR. GRISTLE
                    BOOM!
                         
          WHACK! A box slides over to Trout. A dizzy boxtroll pops out
          for a moment, groaning. Trout taps its head and the boxtroll
          retreats.
                         
                              MR. TROUT
                    You really think these boxtrolls
                    understand the duality of good and
                    evil?
                         
                              MR. PICKLES
                    They must, right? Why else would
                    they hide from us. We are the good
                    guys.
                         
          Mr. Pickles strolls off with both boxtroll and net.
                         
                              MR. GRISTLE (O.S.)
                        (hitting more boxes)
                    Nice! NICE!
                         
          WHACK! Another box slides over to Trout. Trout scoops up the
          box before the creature can get away. The boxtroll's legs
          dangle below as it is carried away.
                         
                              MR. TROUT
                    Yeah... I suppose we are.
                         
          CLOSE ON: Fish and Shoe, in the shadows at the edge of the
          alley, gurgle to each other while the Red Hats are
          distracted. Their heads stay hidden in their boxes as they
          waddle slowly out of the alley.
                                                                    11.
                         
                         
          Mr. Gristle is too preoccupied with smashing other boxes to
          notice them. He grunts and laughs with the effort.
                         
          Snatcher spots Fish and Shoe as they exit the alley and
          points at them.
                         
                                             SNATCHER
                    MR. GRISTLE!
                         
                              MR. GRISTLE
                    Hmm?
                         
                                             SNATCHER
                    ACQUIRE THEM!
                         
          Brandishing his cricket bat, Gristle springs after Fish and
          Shoe.
                         
                              MR. GRISTLE
                    Acquire! ACQUIRE! HAHAHA!
                         
          The boxtrolls pop out of their boxes and RUN!
                         
                         
          EXT. CHEESEBRIDGE STREET
                         
          Gristle closes in on them as they sprint down an alley. The
          boxtrolls join hands and vault over a fence like a Slinky
          toy.
                         
          Gristle smashes THROUGH the fence--
                         
                              MR. GRISTLE
                    COME BACK AND LET ME HIT YOU!
                         
          --but the boxtrolls have disappeared. Gristle stalks down the
          street and disappears around a corner.
                         
          After Gristle disappears, two boxes that are holding up a
          broken street cart suddenly move. It's Fish and Shoe hiding
          in plain sight.
                         
          Once they are sure they are not being followed they open a
          drainage pipe and slip underground into the sewers--

          drop through the chutes, sliding on the cardboard, until they
          join up with other boxtrolls returning from a night of
          gathering.
                                                                     12.
                         
                         
          They descend deeper underground until they are collected
          together in a funnel-shaped cave and one by one drop onto an--

          -- elaborate conveyor belt system for a roller coaster ride
          into a HUGE DARK SPACE with blinking lights and a cacophony
          of MECHANICAL NOISE. Fish, Shoe and boxtrolls of all shapes
          and sizes shoot off the end of the conveyor belt and tumble
          across the floor.
                         
          ON FISH AND SHOE where the alarm clock lands on the floor as
          they tumble to a halt. Shoe grabs the clock possessively,
          hisses at Fish, and runs away laughing. He has his treasure.
          Fish shrugs it off and rights himself, raising a hand to his
          mouth.

          of workshops, interconnected machines and a constellation of
          lights that make it look like a subterranean Coney Island
          amusement park. Fish stands in front of a large STALAGMITE,

          boxtroll named BUCKET work side by side on an electrical
          generator, fitting dinner forks into a toaster as makeshift
          fuses.

                    ""Eggs?""
                         
          Sparky and Bucket look up from their work and give Fish
          directions to find Eggs.
                         
                              SPARKY AND BUCKET
                        (gurgled in unison)
                    ""Over there!""
                         
          In the background, Oil Can climbs down a pipe to grease up
          the generator and then scrambles back up the pipe.
                         
          Fish heads off as Sparky and Bucket turn on the toaster and
          get ZAPPED! They jerk and squirm as electricity courses
          through their boxes and they collapse on the ground. The
          strands of light bulbs flicker and light up.
                         
          Sparky and Bucket smile and beat their boxes in delight -
          they fixed the generator. The two boxtrolls holding the rope
          let go and beat their boxes. Knickers falls to the ground.
                         
                                              KNICKERS

          Fish arrives at a SUBTERRANEAN GARDEN where boxtrolls sit
          among huge cabbages eating ladybugs and slugs. Fish stops in
          front of FRAGILE, a giant, slow moving, dim-witted boxtroll.

          A TINY CRAB BOAT (CRABBY) crests over massive swells.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Alright buddy, we're here. Right
           where you paid me to bring you.
           Question is, why?
                         
          A metallic blue sports car, circa the `60s, emerges from the
           2.

           A car? Hey pal, you can't get any
           further away from land than out
           here.
                         
                          FINN
           Exactly where I want to be.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Well I got news for you, buddy.
           There's nobody out here but us.
                         
          Suddenly, a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise
          ships. FINN quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight.
                         
                          COMBAT SHIP
           What are you doing out here?

           you came from.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Yeah? And who's gonna make me?
                         
          A laser sight hits Crabby between the eyes.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Alright, alright! Don't get your
           prop in a twist.
           (as he turns to leave)
           What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks
           like it's the end of the line.
           Buddy?
                         
          ON CRABBY'S DECK: Finn is gone.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          FINN - He HANGS off the side of COMBAT SHIP, clandestine.
                         
          We're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the
          darkness with purpose. Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps
          a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn,
          the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK.
           3.
                         
                         
          THWAP! Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS
          toward it. He's going to SLAM into the side with brute force
                         WHEN ---

          derrick and now DRIVES VERTICALLY UP UP UP...
                         
          From this vantage point, hundreds of derricks appear.

          Finn approaches a loading bay from above, hides. He watches
          as GREMLINS, PACERS and assorted other cars scurry about.

           Over.
                         
          AN ACCESS DOOR OPENS LOUDLY below. A boxy, monacle-wearing
          German car enters. This is PROFESSOR OTTO ZUNDAPP.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           (in German and English)
           Too many cars here. Out of my way!
                         
                          FINN
           Professor Zundapp?
                         
           PACER (O.S.)
           Here it is, Professor.
                         
          Zundapp approaches a NOSY PACER who idles next to a CRATE.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           You wanted to see this before we
           load it?
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Ah, yes. Very carefully...
                         
          A forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA, packed
          carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           Oh. A TV camera. What does it
           actually do?
           4.
                         
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           This camera is extremely dangerous.
                         
                          FINN
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           What are you up to now, Professor?
                         
          Finn, angling for a better view, FIRES SUSPENSION WIRES ---
                         
          --- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick ---
                         
          --- THOK! They hook tightly onto a steel girder.
                         
          Finn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat, then expels
          another cross-wire for support.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           This is valuable equipment. Make
           sure it is properly secured for the
           voyage.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           You got it.
                         
          Finn LOWERS HIMSELF. He snaps more pictures.
                         
           GREM (O.S.)
           Hey, Professor Z!
                         
          Zundapp turns as a CRANE LOWERS A CAR-SIZED CRATE. GREM and
          ACER, an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer, flank it.
                         
                          GREM
           This is one of those British spies
           we told you about.
                         
                          ACER
           Yeah. This one we caught sticking
           his bumper where it didn't belong.
                         
          Finn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies
          himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Agent Leland Turbo.
                         
          The crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo.
                         
          Finn's eyes go wide. Suddenly --- WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick
          flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the
          Professor. He looks up.
           5.
                         
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the
           camera! Kill him!!
                         
          Finn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He
                         STOPS:
                         
          BAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just
          came from - BLOWTORCHES ready.
                         
          Finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry CRANE. Finn GRINS,
          having just found his escape.
                         
          THWAPTHWAPTHWAP!!! Finn releases three of his four cables,
          swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE
                         CRANE ---
                         
          --- where he lands on its BOOM, drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT
          where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck!
                         
          Finn now DRIVES, spraying oil and screeching around corners.
          A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control ---
                         
          --- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig!
                         
          The Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity...
                         
          He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces.
                         
          ON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has
          nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He
          spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts
          through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp,
          PAST FINN ---
                         
          --- PAST the pursuing CARS ---
                         
          --- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back
          UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS!
                         
          ON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No
          more road. Nowhere else to go.
                         
          The 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him,
          fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce.
                         
          Finn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means
          he's got something cooking.
                         
          Finn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge
          of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars.
                         
          Finn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly
          cutting into the water.
           6.
                         
                         
          He EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away.
                         
                          GREM
                          (NONPLUSSED)
           Get to the boats.
                         
          THE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea
          and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make
          up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they
          do so.
                         
                          ACER
           He's getting away!
                         
                          COMBAT SHIP
           Not for long.
                         
          The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water.
          It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and
          EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the
          night clouds.
                         
          UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS.
          We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now
          CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four
          DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts.
                         
          ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far
          away.
                         
           GREM (OVER RADIO)
           He's dead, Professor.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile
           gone, who can stop us now?
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
                         
          TOW MATER, a rusty tow truck, putters into view.
                         
                          MATER
           Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is
           here to help you!
                         
          He approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road. He
          drives around to the front, catching OTIS' face for the first
          time.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, Otis!
           7.
                         
                         
                          OTIS
           Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I
           thought I could make it this time,
           but...
           (he tries to start his
           engine, stalls)
           Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who
           am I kidding? I'll always be a
           lemon.
                         
          Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him.
                         
                          MATER
           Well dadgum, you're leaking oil
           again. Must be your gaskets. Hey,
           look on the bright side: This is
           your tenth tow this month, so that
           means it's on the house.
                         
                          OTIS
           You're the only one that's nice to
           lemons like me, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Don't sweat it. These things happen
           to everybody, Otis.
                         
                          OTIS
           But you never leak oil.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't
           tell nobody, but I think my rust is
           starting to show through.
                         
          Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN.
          It has been amended to say: ""Home of Lightning McQueen.""
                         
                          OTIS
           Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet?
                         
                          MATER
           Not yet.
                         
                          OTIS
           He must be crazy-excited about
           winning his fourth Piston Cup.
           Four! Wow!
           8.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him.
           But I sure wish he'd hurry up and
           get back `cause we got a whole
           summer's worth of best friend fun
           to make up for. Just me and --
                         
          Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible.
                         
                          MATER
           --- McQueen!
                         
          Mater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him.
                         
                          OTIS
           Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You
           don't need to go so fast!
                         
          Boom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air.
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
                         
          Lightning McQueen is surrounded by his hometown friends.
                         
                          LUIGI
           Oh, Lightning. Welcome home.

           Good to have you back, honey.

                          SHERIFF
           The place wasn't the same without
           you, son.
                         
                          LIZZIE
           What? Did he go somewhere?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           It's good to be home, everybody.

           McQueen!
                         
          They all turn around, see Mater speeding into town, with Otis
          swerving behind him.
                         
                          MCQUEEN

           McQueen!
                         
          Mater skids into main street and in one swift motion,
          slingshots Otis forward ---
                         
                          OTIS
           Woaahhhhh!
                         
          --- right through Ramone's front door ---
                         
          INT. RAMONE'S - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --- where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift. Ramone
          lifts him up, routine.
                         
                          RAMONE
           Hey. How far'd you make it this
           time, Otis?
                         
                          OTIS
           Halfway to the county line.
                         
                          RAMONE
           Not bad, man.
                         
                          OTIS
           I know, I can't believe it either!

           McQueen, welcome back!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, it's so good to see you.
                         
                          MATER
           You too, buddy.
                         
          Mater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP (fist bump
          style).
                         
                          MATER
           Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe
           the things I got planned for us.
                         
          Everyone watches as the tire bump continues.

           longer every year.

                          MATER
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           You ready to have some serious fun?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Well, actually I've got something
           to show you first.
                         
          INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS MUSEUM - DAY
                         
          CLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP. It has now changed, been adorned
          with a small likeness of Doc. It says ""Hudson Hornet Piston
          Cup.""
                         
                          MATER
           Wow. I can't believe they renamed
           the Piston Cup after our very own
           Doc Hudson.
                         
          McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public.
          McQueen approaches a ""Hudson Hornet"" wall with Doc's three
          Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I know Doc said these things were
           just old cups, but to have someone
           else win it just didn't feel right,
           you know?
                         
                          MATER
           Well, Doc would've been real proud
           of you. That's for sure.
                         
          McQueen takes this in.
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - LATER
                         
          McQueen and Mater exit the Doc Hudson Museum.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Alright, pal. I've been waiting all
           summer for this. What've you got
           planned?
                         
                          MATER
           You sure you can handle it?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Come on, you know who you're
           talking to? This is Lightning
           McQueen. I can handle anything.
           11.
                         
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
                         
          Mater and McQueen roll on an old train track, their tires
          off. They're on their rims.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Uh.... Mater?!
                         
                          MATER
           Just remember, your brakes ain't
           gonna work on these!
                         
          As they head INTO A DARK TUNNEL ---
                         
           MCQUEEN (O.S.)
           Mater!
                         
           MATER (O.S.)
           Relax, these train tracks ain't
           been used in years!
                         
          From inside the tunnel a loud TRAIN HORN. The two friends
          emerge, going as fast as they can on train tracks, uphill,
          with no tires.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Come on, come on! Faster, faster!
                         
          Moments later a harmless GALLOPING GOOSE appears, oversized
          horn visible, cackling and laughing at his prank.
                         
          EXT. FIELD - OUTSIDE RADIATOR SPRINGS - LATER
                         
          An ENORMOUS EARTH MOVER sleeps. McQueen and Mater sneak up.
                         
                          MATER
           This is gonna be good!
                         
          They blow their horns and he TIPS OVER, tractor-tipping
          style. They LAUGH at the gag, but soon realize the earth
          mover's GIANT EXHAUST PIPE is directly above them.
                         
                          MATER
           Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good.
                         
          The exhaust pipe BELCHES. McQueen and Mater are BLASTED out
          of view.
                         
          INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DUSK
                         
          The sun sets. McQueen and Mater roll into town. McQueen looks
          exhausted. Mater is still full of energy.
           12.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Boy, this was the best day ever!
           And my favorite souvenir?
                         
          Mater proudly shows off a dent.
                         
                          MATER
           This new dent!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Boy, Mater. Today was, uh...
                         
                          MATER
           Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til
           you see what I got planned for
           tonight.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of
           thinking of just a quiet dinner.
                         
                          MATER
           That's exactly what I was thinking.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Even better! You, me and Miss Sally
           going out for supper.
                         
          McQueen pulls around in front of Mater, stops.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, I meant it would be just me
           and Sally.
                         
                          MATER
           Oh.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           It's just for tonight. We'll do
           whatever you want tomorrow.
                         
                          MATER
                          (DISAPPOINTED)
           Okay.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Thanks for understanding.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have
           fun now.
           13.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Alright, then. See ya soon, amigo!
                         
          McQueen drives off. Mater watches him go.
                         
          EXT. THE WHEEL WELL - NIGHT
                         
          It's been converted into a white-tablecloth restaurant, with
          cars dining al fresco and a hopping gastropub inside.
                         
          MCQUEEN AND SALLY have a prime table with a view of Radiator
          Springs and the starry night sky.
                         
                          SALLY
           This is so nice.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I can't tell you how good it is to
           be here alone. Just the two of us.
           Finally, you and me ---
                         
           MATER (O.S.)
           Good evening.
                         
          Mater is at their table, dressed as a waiter.
                         
                          MATER
           My name is Mater and I'll be your
           waiter.
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Mater the waiter. That's funny
           right there.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, you work here?
                         
                          MATER
           Well yeah I work here. What'd you
           think, I just snuck in here when
           nobody was looking and pretended to
           be your waiter, just so I could
           hang out with you?
                         
          McQueen and Sally exchange a look.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that
           be?
                         
                          MATER
           Now, can I start you two lovebirds
           off with a couple drinks?
           14.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Yes. I'll have my usual.
                         
                          SALLY
           You know what? I'm going to have
           that too.
                         
          Mater blinks.
                         
                          MATER
           Uh, right. Your usual.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INSIDE AT THE BAR - Fillmore and Sarge watch as Guido mixes
          drinks, ala ""Cocktail."" Mater arrives.
                         
                          MATER
           Guido! What's McQueen's usual?
                         
                          GUIDO
           (in Italian, subtitled)
           How should I know?
                         
                          MATER
           Perfect! Give me two of `em.
                         
                          SARGE
           Quiet! My program's on.
                         
           MEL DORADO (O.S.)
           Tonight on ""The Mel Dorado Show""!
                         
          ON THE BAR TV - ""THE MEL DORADO SHOW,"" a cable talk show,
          begins with file footage of MILES AXLEROD, a sleek SUV.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           His story gripped the world! Oil
           billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an
           attempt to become the first car to
           circumnavigate the globe without
           GPS, ironically ran out of gas and
           found himself trapped in the wild!
                         
          We see images of newspaper headlines, search crews.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Feared dead, he emerged 36 days
           later, running on a fuel he'd
           distilled himself from the natural
           elements! Since then he's sold his
           oil fortune, converted himself from
           a gas-guzzler into an electric car,
           and has devoted his life to finding
           a renewable, clean-burning fuel!
           15.
                         
                         
          Images of oil derricks torn down; Miles Axlerod getting
          converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Now he claims to have done it with
           his Allinol.
                         
          Images of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all
          combining to form the Allinol logo.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           And to show the world what his new
           superfuel can do, he's created a
           racing competition like no other,
           inviting the greatest champions
           from around the globe to battle in
           the first ever World Grand Prix.
           Welcome Sir Miles Axlerod.
                         
          SIR MILES AXLEROD arrives, parks across from Mel's desk.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Thank you, Mel. It is very good to
           be here. Now listen to me: Big Oil.
           It costs a fortune. Pollution is
           getting worse. I mean, come on.
           It's a fossil fuel. Fossil. As in
           dead dinosaurs. And we all know
           what happened to them. Alternative
           energy is the future. Trust me,
           Mel, after seeing Allinol in action
           at the World Grand Prix, nobody
           will ever go back to gasoline
           again.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FILLMORE)
           What happened to the dinosaurs,
           now?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           And on satellite, a World Grand
           Prix competitor and one of the
           fastest cars in the world,
           Francesco Bernoulli.
                         
          Across the screen: LIVE FROM ROME, ITALY. We meet Formula
          race car FRANCESCO BERNOULLI.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           It is an honor, Signore Dorado. For
           you.

           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Miles, why not invite Lightning
           McQueen?
                         
          Mater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half-intrigued.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Of course we invited him. But
           apparently after a very long racing
           season he is taking some time off
           to rest.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Lightning McQueen would not have a
           chance against Francesco!
                         
          Mater doesn't like this.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           I can go over 300 kilometers an
           hour! In miles that is like, uh...
           way faster than McQueen.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Let's go to the phones. Baltimore,
           Maryland, you're on the air.
                         
           CALLER (ON TV)
           Am I on? Hello?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           You're on. Go ahead.
                         
           CALLER (ON TV)
           Hello?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Go ahead, caller.
                         
          Dial tone.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Let's go to Radiator Springs.
           You're on, caller.
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           Yeah, that Italian feller you got
           on there can't talk that way about
           Lightning McQueen. He's the bestest
           race car in the whole wide world.

      A path of marigold petals leads up to an altar lovingly
      arranged in a humble cemetery. An old woman lights a candle
      as the smoke of burning copal wood dances lyrically upward...

      CARD: DISNEY PRESENTS

      CARD: A PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS FILM

      The smoke lifts up toward lines of papel picado ?- cut paper
      banners -- that sway gently in the breeze.

      PAPEL PICADO CARD: ""COCO""

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Sometimes I think I'm cursed...
                  'cause of something that happened
                  before I was even born.

      A story begins to play out on the papel picado.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  See, a long time ago there was this
                  family.

      The images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a
      father, a mother, and a little girl. The family is happy.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  The pap?, he was a musician.

      The pap? plays guitar while the mother dances with her
      daughter.

                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  He and his family would sing, and
                  dance, and count their blessings...
                      (beat)
                  But he also had a dream... to play
                  for the world.
                      (beat)
                  And one day he left with his
                  guitar... and never returned.

      The man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In
      another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching
      her pap? leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her
      mam?, hardened.

      She shuts the door.





                                                                     2.


                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  And the mam?...? She didn't have
                  time to cry over that walkaway
                  musician!
                      (beat)
                  After banishing all music from her
                  life...

      The woman gets rid of all of her husband's instruments and
      records.

                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  She found a way to provide for her
                  daughter...
                      (beat)
                  She rolled up her sleeves and she
                  learned to make shoes.
                      (beat)
                  She could have made candy!

      Amongst the papel picado, a stick swings at a strung up
      pi?ata which bursts with candy...

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Or fireworks!

      Fireworks go off in the background...

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers!

      Sparkly underwear and a luchador mask hang on a line amongst
      other linens...

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  But no... she chose shoes...

      On the papel picado, the little girl becomes a young woman.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Then she taught her daughter to
                  make shoes. And later, she taught
                  her son-in-law.

      She introduces a suitor to the family business.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Then her grandkids got roped in.
                  As her family grew, so did the
                  business.

      In the next vignette, a bunch of goofy grandchildren join in
      the shoemaking. The shoe shop is full of family!




                                                                     3.


                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Music had torn her family apart,
                  but shoes held them all together.
                      (beat)
                  You see, that woman was my great-
                  great grandmother, Mam? Imelda.

      TILT DOWN from the papel picado to the


      OFRENDA ROOM - DAY

      where a photo sits at the top of a beautiful altar. The
      photo features MAM? IMELDA -- serious, formidable. She holds
      a baby on her lap. Her husband stands beside her, but his
      face has been torn away.

                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  She died WAY before I was born.
                  But my family still tells her story
                  every year on D?a de los Muertos --
                  the Day of the Dead...
                      (beat)
                  And her little girl?

      Fade from the face of the little girl to present day MAM?
      COCO (97), a living raisin, convalescing in a wicker
      wheelchair.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  She's my great grandmother, Mam?
                  Coco.

      A boy (12) walks into frame and kisses her on the cheek.
      This is our narrator, MIGUEL.

                            MIGUEL
                  Hol?, Mam? Coco.

                  How are you, Julio?

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Actually, my name is Miguel. Mam?
                  Coco has trouble remembering
                  things... But it's good to talk to
                  her anyway. So I tell her pretty
                  much everything.

      QUICK CUTS of Miguel with Mam? Coco:

      EXT. COURTYARD

                            MIGUEL
                  I used to run like this...

      Miguel pumps his arms with his hands in fists.           Then he
      switches to flat palms.

                            MIGUEL
                  But now I run like this which is
                  way faster!

      INT. MAM? COCO'S ROOM

      Miguel, in a luchador mask, climbs onto the bed, arms raised.

                            MIGUEL
                  And the winner is... Luchadora
                  Coco!

      Miguel leaps off the bed onto a pile of pillows that bursts,
      sending feathers onto Mam? Coco who wears a mask of her own.

                                                       CUT TO:


      EXT. DINING AREA

      Miguel leans toward Mam? Coco at the dinner table.

                            MIGUEL
                  I have a dimple on this side, but
                  not on this side. Dimple. No
                  dimple. Dimple. No dimple--

                             ABUELITA
                  Miguel!   Eat your food.

      Miguel's ABUELITA (70s) runs the table like a ship captain.
      She gives Mam? Coco a kiss on the head.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  My Abuelita? She's Mam? Coco's
                  daughter.

      Abuelita piles extra tamales on Miguel's plate.

                            ABUELITA
                  Aw, you're a twig, mijo.         Have some
                  more.




                                                                       5.


                            MIGUEL
                  No, gracias.

                            ABUELITA
                  I asked if you would like more
                  tamales.

                               MIGUEL
                  S-s??

                            ABUELITA
                  That's what I THOUGHT you said.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Abuelita runs our house just like
                  Mam? Imelda did.

      INT. OFRENDA ROOM - DAY

      Abuelita adjusts the photo of her beloved Mam? Imelda. Then
      she perks her ear at a hooting sound.


      INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      Miguel idly blows into a glass soda bottle.     Abuelita takes
      the bottle away.

                               ABUELITA
                  No music!


      INT. MAM? COCO'S ROOM - DAY

      Miguel listens as a truck drives by the window, blaring radio
      tunes. Abuelita angrily slams the window shut.

                               ABUELITA
                  No music!!


      EXT. STREET - EVENING

      A trio of gentlemen serenade each other as they stroll by the
      family compound.

                            MUSICIANS
                      (singing)

      Abuelita bursts out of the gate and chases them away.

                            ABUELITA
                  NO MUSIC!!!

      Terrified, the musicians stumble as they run away.

                            MIGUEL (V.O)
                  I think we're the only family in
                  M?xico who hates music...


      INT. RIVERA WORKSHOP - DAY

      We see the Rivera family tinkering in the shoe shop, no music
      to be heard. Miguel jogs past them.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  And my family's fine with that...

      He grabs his shine box, and heads out of the shoe shop.

                              MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  But me?

                            MAM?
                  Be back by lunch, mijo!

                            MIGUEL
                  Love you, Mam?!

      Once outside, Miguel makes his way through the small town of


      SANTA CECILIA - MORNING

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  I am NOT like the rest of my
                  family...

      He passes a woman sweeping a stoop.

                            WOMAN
                  Hola, Miguel!

                              MIGUEL
                  Hola!

      He passes a band of musicians playing a tune. Miguel joins
      with some air guitar and the further down the street he goes,
      the more instruments and sounds layer in. The bells of the
      church chime in harmony, a radio blares a cumbia rhythm.





                                                                      7.


      Running past a food stand, Miguel grabs a roll of pan dulce
      and tosses the vendor a coin.

                            MIGUEL
                  Muchas gracias!

                            STREET VENDOR
                  De nada, Miguel!

      As Miguel passes all these scenes, the music synthesizes and
      he can't help but tap out rhythms along a table of alebrijes.
      The fantastical wooden animal sculptures each play a
      different tone like a marimba. Miguel finishes with a SMACK
      on a trash can, out of which a pops up a scrappy hairless
      Xolo dog. The dog, DANTE, barks and jumps up to lick Miguel,
      who laughs.

                              MIGUEL
                  Hey, hey!    Dante!

      Miguel holds the pan dulce over Dante's head.

                             MIGUEL
                  Sit. Down. Roll over.        Shake.
                  Fist bump.

      Dante obeys to the best of his ability.

                            MIGUEL
                  Good boy, Dante!

      Miguel tosses the pan dulce to his furless friend who topples
      back into the trash can.

      MARIACHI PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER

      Miguel rounds the corner toward the town square. Vendors
      sell sugar skulls and marigolds, and musicians fill the
      square with music.

                             MIGUEL (V.O)
                  I know I'm not supposed to love
                  music -- but it's not my fault!
                      (beat)
                  It's his: Ernesto de la Cruz...

      Miguel approaches a statue of a handsome mariachi at the
      heart of the plaza.

                  ...The greatest musician of all
                  time.

      A tour group and their TOUR GUIDE are gathered around the
      base of the statue.

                  And right here, in this very plaza,

                  his first steps toward becoming the
                  most beloved singer in Mexican
                  history!

                  He started out a total nobody from
                  Santa Cecilia, like me. But when
                  he played music, he made people
                  fall in love with him.

      MORE CLIPS from de la Cruz's films. He leaps from a tree
      branch onto a galloping horse. He plays his signature skull
      guitar with flourish and flair.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  He starred in movies. He had the

                  about... Until 1942...

      As the audience swoons over de la Cruz, an absent-minded
      stagehand leans on a lever. Ropes and pulleys go flying.

      Miguel weaves up to de la Cruz's mausoleum and peeks in the

      guitar.

                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
                  Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and
                  I get this feeling... like we're
                  connected somehow. Like, if HE
                  could play music, maybe someday I
                  could too...

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                  I asked for a shoe shine, not your
                  life story.

      Miguel comes out of his reverie and looks up at the PLAZA
      MARIACHI whose shoes he is shining.

                            MIGUEL
                  Oh, yeah, sorry.

      He goes back to scrubbing the man's shoe.    As Miguel shines,
      the mariachi plucks his guitar idly.

                            MIGUEL
                  I just can't really talk about any
                  of this at home so...

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                  Look, if I were you I'd march right
                  up to my family and say, ""Hey! I'm
                  a musician. Deal with it!""

                            MIGUEL
                  I could never say that...

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                  You ARE a musician, no?

                            MIGUEL
                  I don't know. I mean... I only
                  really play for myself--

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                  Did de la Cruz become the world's
                  best musician by hiding his sweet,
                  sweet skills? No! He walked out
                  onto that plaza and he played out
                  loud!





                                                                     11.


      The mariachi gets an idea. He points to the gazebo where
      organizers are setting up for a show. They unfurl a canvas
      poster which reads ""TALENT SHOW.""

                            PLAZA MARIACHI (CONT'D)
                  Ah, mira, mira! They're setting up
                  for tonight. The music competition
                  for D?a de Muertos. You wanna be

                  Look, if you're too scared, then,
                  well... have fun making shoes.

      Miguel considers this.

                              PLAZA MARIACHI (CONT'D)
                  C'mon.    What did de la Cruz always
                  say?

                            MIGUEL
                  ...Seize your moment?

      The mariachi appraises Miguel, then offers his guitar.

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                  Show me what you got, muchacho.
                  I'll be your first audience.

      Miguel's brows rise, surprised. He reaches to take the
      instrument, regarding it as if holding a holy relic.

      Miguel spreads his fingers across the strings anticipating
      his chord and...

                              ABUELITA (O.S.)
                  MIGUEL!

      Startled, Miguel impulsively throws the guitar back onto the
      mariachi's lap. He turns to see Abuelita marching toward
      him. Miguel's T?O BERTO (40s) and PRIMA ROSA (16), follow
      with supplies from the market.

                              MIGUEL
                  Abuelita!

                            ABUELITA
                  What are you doing here?





                                                                      12.


                               MIGUEL
                  Um...uh...

      Miguel quickly packs away his shine rag and polishes.
      Abuelita barrels up to the mariachi.

      She hits his hat with her shoe and waves him away.

                            ABUELITA
                  You leave my grandson alone!

                            PLAZA MARIACHI
                  Do?a, please -- I was just getting
                  a shine!

                            ABUELITA
                  I know your tricks, mariachi!
                      (to Miguel)
                  What did he say to you?

                            MIGUEL
                  He was just showing me his
                  guitar...

      Gasps from the family.

                            T?O BERTO
                  Shame on you!

      Abuelita lords over the mariachi, shoe aimed directly between
      his eyes.

                            ABUELITA
                  My grandson is a sweet little
                  angelito querido cielito -- he
                  wants no part of your music,
                  mariachi! You keep away from him!

      The mariachi scrambles away, snatching his hat off the
      ground before he goes. Abuelita hugs Miguel protectively to
      her bosom.

                            ABUELITA
                  Ay, pobrecito! Est?s bien, mijo?

      She peppers him with kisses then releases him from the
      embrace. He gasps for air.

                             ABUELITA
                       (distressed)
                  You know better than to be here in
                  this place! You will come home.
                  Now.




                                                                     13.


      Abuelita turns toward home. Miguel sighs and gathers his
      shine box. Then, seeing a flyer for the plaza ""TALENT SHOW"",
      he can't help but pocket it. He follows Abuelita.


      EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

      Miguel catches up to his family.

                             T?O BERTO
                  How many times have we told you --
                  that plaza is crawling with
                  mariachis!

                            MIGUEL
                  Yes, T?o Berto.

      Dante ambles up to Miguel, sniffing and whining for a treat.

                            MIGUEL
                  No, no, no!

      Abuelita shoos him away.

                            ABUELITA
                  Go away, you! Go!

      Dante darts off, scared.

                            MIGUEL
                  It's just Dante...

      Abuelita throws her shoe at the dog.

                             ABUELITA
                  Never name a street dog.         They'll
                  follow you forever.
                      (beat)
                  Now, go get my shoe.

                                                       CUT TO:

      INT. RIVERA WORKSHOP

      The Rivera workshop is abuzz with family making shoes.
      WHOMP! Miguel is plopped onto a stool, ready for a lecture.

                            ABUELITA
                  I found your son in Mariachi Plaza!

                            PAP?
                      (disappointed)
                  Miguel...




                                                                              14.


                             MAM?
                  You know how Abuelita feels about
                  the plaza.

                            MIGUEL
                  I was just shining shoes!

                            T?O BERTO
                  A musician's shoes!

      Gasps from the family. PRIMO ABEL (19) is so shocked he
      loses his grip on the shoe he is polishing, which zips away
      from the polisher and lodges itself in the roof.

                            MIGUEL
                  But the plaza's where all the foot
                  traffic is.

                            PAP?
                  If Abuelita says no more plaza,
                  then no more plaza.

                            MIGUEL
                      (blurting)
                  But what about tonight?

                            PAP? FRANCO
                  What's tonight?

                            MIGUEL
                  Well they're having this talent
                  show-

      Abuelita perks her ear, suspicious.          Miguel squirms, deciding
      whether to go on.

                            MIGUEL
                  And I thought I might...

      Mam? looks at Miguel, curious.

                            MAM?
                  ...Sign up?

                            MIGUEL
                  Well, maybe?

                            PRIMA ROSA
                      (laughing)
                  You have to have talent to be in a
                  talent show.





                                                                   15.


                            PRIMO ABEL
                  What are YOU going to do, shine
                  shoes?

      The shoe from the ceiling falls back down on Abel's head.

                            ABUELITA
                  It's D?a de los Muertos -- no one's
                  going anywhere. Tonight is about
                  family.

      She deposits a pile of marigolds in Miguel's arms.

                            ABUELITA
                  Ofrenda room. V?monos.

                                                   CUT TO:


      INT. OFRENDA ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Miguel follows his Abuelita to the family ofrenda, holding
      the pile of flowers as she arranges them on the altar.

                             ABUELITA
                  Don't give me that look. D?a de
                  los Muertos is the one night of the
                  year our ancestors can come visit
                  us.
                      (beat)
                  We've put their photos on the
                  ofrenda so their spirits can cross
                  over. That is very important! If
                  we don't put them up, they can't
                  come!
                      (beat)
                  We made all this food -- set out
                  the things they loved in life,
                  mijo. All this work to bring the
                  family together. I don't want you
                  sneaking off to who-knows-where.

      She looks up to find Miguel sneaking away.

                            ABUELITA (CONT'D)
                  Where are you going?

                            MIGUEL
                  I thought we were done...





                                                                 16.


                            ABUELITA
                  Ay, Dios m?o... Being part of this
                  family means being HERE for this
                  family... I don't want to see you
                  end up like--

      Abuelita looks up to the photo of the faceless musician.

                            MIGUEL
                  Like Mam? Coco's pap??

                            ABUELITA
                  Never mention that man!      He's
                  better off forgotten.

                            MIGUEL
                  But you're the one who--

                            ABUELITA
                  Ta, ta, ta-tch!

                            MIGUEL
                  I was just--

                              ABUELITA
                  Tch-tch!

                              MIGUEL
                  But--

                              ABUELITA
                  Tch!

                              MIGUEL
                  I--

                              ABUELITA
                  Tch-tch!

                              MAM? COCO
                  Pap??

      They look to find Mam? Coco agitated.

                            MAM? COCO (CONT'D)
                  Pap? is home...?

                            ABUELITA
                  Mam?, c?lmese, c?lmese.

                            MAM? COCO
                  Pap? is coming home?





                                                                      17.


                             ABUELITA
                  No Mam?.   It's okay, I'm here.

      Mam? Coco looks up at Abuelita.

                            MAM? COCO
                  Who are you?

      Sadness rises in Abuelita; she swallows it down.

                            ABUELITA
                  Rest, Mam?.

      Abuelita returns to the ofrenda.

                             ABUELITA (CONT'D)
                  I'm hard on you because I care,
                  Miguel.
                      (beat)
                  Miguel... Miguel?

      She looks around the room. Miguel is nowhere to be found.
      Abuelita steps up to the ofrenda.

                             ABUELITA (CONT'D)
                      (sigh)
                  What are we going to do with that
                  boy...?

      She looks to the photo of Mam? Imelda.       Abuelita's eyes
      brighten with an idea.

                            ABUELITA (CONT'D)
                  You're right. That's just what he
                  needs!

                                                    CUT TO:


      EXT. SIDE STREET

      T?o Berto unloads rolls of leather from a truckbed. Nearby,
      Dante sleeps under the shade of a tree. He startles awake by
      a faint TWANGING. The dog scrambles up to the roof.

      He reaches a shoe sign advertising the Rivera Family business
      and lifts it up.


      INT. ROOFTOP HIDEOUT

      Dante pokes his head in.      Miguel turns and gasps.





                                                                    18.


                            MIGUEL
                  Oh, it's you. Get in here, c'mon,
                  Dante. Hurry up.

      Dante wriggles into the hideout. Miguel is huddled over
      something. The dog peeks around his shoulder.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  You're gonna get me in trouble,
                  boy. Someone could hear me!

      Miguel reveals a makeshift guitar, cobbled together from a
      beat up old soundboard and random other items.

      He takes a china marker and sketches a nose on what appears
      to be his own version of a skull guitar head.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  I wish someone wanted to hear me...

      Miguel tunes the guitar.

                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  Other than you...

      Dante gives Miguel a big sloppy lick. Miguel gives a grossed-
      out chuckle. He lifts his guitar and strums.

                              MIGUEL (CONT'D)
                  Perfecto!

      He crawls to the far side of the attic where he's built his
      own ofrenda to Ernesto de la Cruz. Posters, candles, and
      songbooks are arranged with care. Miguel lights the candles
      with reverence, illuminating an album cover of de la Cruz
      holding his skull guitar.

      Miguel compares the head of his guitar to the album cover.
      Then he imitates de la Cruz's pose and smile.

      He switches on a beat up old TV and pushes a tape into the
      VCR, ""Best of de la Cruz"" scrawled on the spine.

      A montage of the greatest moments from de la Cruz's films
      plays out.

      A clip from ""A QUIEN YO AMO:""

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  I have to sing. I have to play.
                  The music, it's -- it's not just in
                  me. It is me.





                                                                     19.


      Miguel strums his guitar as de la Cruz imparts his wisdom.
      More clips run in the background as Miguel plays:

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  When life gets me down, I play my
                  guitar.

      In a clip from ""A QUIEN YO AMO:""

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  The rest of the world may follow
                  the rules, but I must follow my
                  heart!

      De la Cruz kisses a woman passionately.      Miguel cringes.

      Another clip from ""A QUIEN YO AMO:""

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  You know that feeling? Like
                  there's a song in the air and it's
                  playing just for you...

      As Miguel watches de la Cruz play guitar in the video, he
      repeats the melody on his own guitar.

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                      (singing)
                  A FEELING SO CLOSE
                  YOU COULD REACH OUT AND TOUCH IT
                  I NEVER KNEW I COULD
                  WANT SOMETHING SO MUCH
                  BUT IT'S TRUE...

      As a good-natured priest in ""NUESTRA IGLESIA:""

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  You must have faith, sister.

                            NUN (FILM CLIP)
                  Oh but Padre, he will never listen.

                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
                  He will listen... to MUSIC!
                      (singing)

          A HAUNTING LULLABY plays against a black, star-pricked
          sky when something appears in the distance. A BUTTON-EYED
          DOLL floats towards CAMERA, through the open window of a
          small sewing room where it lands in a pair of WAITING
          HANDS, hands that are made of SEWING NEEDLES.

          
          The doll - which resembles a YOUNG BLACK GIRL in old-
          fashioned clothes, hair fixed with ribbons and braids -
          is placed on a sewing table. An elaborate sewing kit is
          opened, and, in flickering green light, the NEEDLE-HANDS
          go to work. The doll's old clothes are cut away; button-
          eyes torn off; hair pulled out. The doll's stuffing is
          removed and then the empty cloth body is pulled inside
          out, turning from NUT BROWN to PALE PINK.

          
          Sawdust is poured in the NEW DOLL's mouth; facial
          features added; blue yarn hair punched in; and then a
          fresh pair of shiny black button eyes is selected from a
          button drawer.

          
          The transformed doll, in a LITTLE YELLOW RAINCOAT, its
          new button eyes affixed, is released out the window and

          BACK INTO THE NIGHT.

          

          LAST HEAD CREDIT APPEARS, THEN FADES.

          

          

          EXT PINK PALACE, ASHLAND OREGON - DAY

          
          WIDE ANGLE on a rambling old Queen Anne-style house with
          tacked-on outside stairs. It's late winter, the sky a
          damp, grey sponge. A SIGN in the foreground reads ""Pink
          Palace, Apartment for Rent"".

          
          MR. BOBINSKY - a seven-foot-tall blue-skinned man -
          performs calisthenics on the rooftop, counting in
          Russian.

          

                                 MR. BOBINSKY
                    Dras, dva, tri, chetyri.
                    Dras, dva, tri, chetyri.
                    Dras, dva, tri ...

          

          
          A BEEPING SOUND begins and he pauses. A tired MOVING VAN
          backs into frame and up the muddy driveway. A VW BEETLE -
          suitcases roped to its top - recklessly passes the truck
          and disappears around the side of the house. Bobinsky
          shakes his fist angrily after the car and shouts:

          

                                   MR. BOBINSKY (CONT'D)
                    Mer-sa-vich!

          
          He marches away indignantly. One of the MOVERS, unseen in
          the truck, speaks to his companion.

          

                                 MOVER 2 (O.C.)
                    We're here. Time to muscle up.

          

          
          ANGLE ON moving truck's REAR DOORS as they're wrenched
          open by two men - MOVER 1, tall and bear-shaped, and
          MOVER 2, built like a brick top - to reveal a lot of
          BOXES and BEAT-UP FURNITURE.

          
          They haul out the LOADING RAMP towards CAMERA.

          
          NEW ANGLE, EXTERIOR STAIRS to BASEMENT FLAT. APRIL SPINK,
          a rotund little old English lady with bad legs, surveys
          the MOVERS as they pass by her chair-lift with boxes and
          furniture. The old gal can't wait to tell her flat mate
          below about the young, strapping men.

          

                                 MOVER 2 (CONT'D)

                           (EFFORTS)
                    Got it? Almost there, just a few more.
                    Come on, now, LIFT.

          
          ANGLE ON FRONT PORCH. The job finished, Mover 2 heads
          down the front steps while Mover 1 waits for a signature
          from the unseen-but-for-his-hands new tenant. Papers
          signed, a tip of a single, grubby dollar bill is placed
          in the outstretched hand of the disappointed mover, and
          the door is shut.

          

          

          EXT HOUSE, REAR VIEW - SAME

          
          ANGLE from BACK YARD. Hiding behind shrubs, WE SHARE the
          POV of a MYSTERIOUS SPY. With a CLICK, a close-up lens is
          rotated into place to better see the movers quietly pack
          into the truck and drive away. A MANGY BLACK CAT walks
          right in front of the lens and looks at us with concern.
          OFF-SCREEN, a door bangs open. WE FOLLOW the cat as it
          races up a tree and out a branch towards the BACK PORCH
          to investigate.

          
          CORALINE JONES, 11, steps onto the porch in a YELLOW
          RAINCOAT with a shoulder bag. WE - SPY'S POV - CLICK to a
          CLOSE-UP to find this new tenant has BLUE HAIR and a
          skeptical face.

          
          NEW ANGLE, non-spy reverse, on Coraline as she glances
          furtively over her shoulder, then hops down the steps and
          moves diagonally away from the house.

          
          NEW Angle, SPY POV. We watch Coraline head towards the
          WOODY SHRUB we've hidden ourselves in. We DUCK DOWN.

          
          ANGLE on Coraline, non-spy, shrub by garden gate. She
          reaches into the shrub and breaks off a FORKED BRANCH.
          She removes the stick's red leaves, aims it like a
          DOWSING ROD and heads into the garden.

          
          CAM PUSH IN to shrub as the SPY RISES UP, wearing a three-
          eyed SKELETON MASK on his head and SKELETON GLOVES on his
          hands. The black cat hops into frame, glances at the spy
          and follows the girl.

          

          

          MONTAGE VARIOUS EXT - SAME

          

          AFISH POND IN GARDEN - SAME

          
          Coraline explores the drained, crumbling pond. She finds
          an old TURTLE SHELL in the muck and holds it up. After
          rapping on it to make sure it's empty, she puts the shell
          into her shoulder bag.

          
          ANGLE ON CAROLINE, SPY POV. WE PUSH ASIDE dead vines from
          the railing of the GARDEN BRIDGE for a better look.
          Coraline aims her forked stick once more then follows it
          up from the pond and out the BACK GATE. A gust of WIND
          blows DEAD LEAVES into a swirling eddy WE TRACK high up
          into the air.

          

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

          

          

          ROCKY PATH HIGH ABOVE HOUSE - LITTLE LATER

          
          SPY POV on sky, now dark with GATHERING STORM. Hidden
          behind a NATURAL WALL OF STONES, WE TILT DOWN to view
          Coraline crossing frame on a STEEP HILLSIDE path. She
          steps on an old RAILROAD TIE, and her foot SINKS into the
          rotted wood, stopping her.

          
          WE LEAN OUT for a better view, and DISLODGE some stones
          that roll down past her. WE DUCK as she jerks her head
          our way.

          
          NEW ANGLE, non-spy. Unnerved, Coraline calls out.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hello?...   Who's there?

          
          She throws a rock over the wall of stones, HITS THE
          UNSEEN SPY, causing a CRY OF PAIN. ANIMAL? HUMAN? Freaked
          out, she GASPS, runs up the trail.

          
          NEW ANGLE, SPY POV. We rise up to watch and the black cat
          hops onto the stone wall.

          

          

          EXT. OVERGROWN ORCHARD - CONT.


          
          Coraline races down past an OLD TRACTOR and into an
          ORCHARD. WIND begins to blow.

          
          NEW ANGLE as we move beside Coraline through the old
          apple trees, where she nearly trips on the tongue of a
          harvest cart.

          
          DOWN ANGLE ON on Coraline as she BACKS INTO a circle of
          TOADSTOOLS in front of a STUMP. BREATHING HARD, she looks
          out for her pursuer.

          
          NEW ANGLE. The black cat shoots past Coraline in the tall
          grass. She can't see him but she knows something is
          there. Already behind her now, the cat LEAPS onto the
          stump with a loud, warning MEROWWW!

          
          STARTLED, Coraline YELLS and whips around. She's both
          angry and relieved when she sees it's just some cat.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You scared me to death, you mangy thing!

          
          Cat GLARES at her with BLUE OPAL EYES, makes a low growl
          as she stands. She exhales.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    I'm just looking for an old well. Know
                    it?

          
          Cat BLINKS EYES slowly.

          

                                 CORALINE(CONT'D)
                    Not talking, huh?

          
          The wind picks up. She grasps the forks of her stick,
          closes her eyes, and, tracing a figure eight above her,

          SAYS:

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Magic dowser, magic dowser: show... me...
                    the well!

          
          ANGLE ON CORALINE FROM HIGH BLUFF. The SPY moves into
          frame, astride some kind of MOTOR-BIKE. He presses a
          button on the handlebars and BLASTS a loud AIR HORN.
          STARTLED, Coraline SPINS around.

          
          UP ANGLE ON SPY. As LIGHTNING FLASHES and THUNDER ROLLS,
          Coraline sees him for the first time. With his turret-
          lensed SKULL MASK and SKELETON GLOVES and black FIREMAN'S
          COAT flapping in the wind, he looks like a PSYCHO KILLER!

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                           (freaked out)

                    AHHHHH!

          
          He REVS his motor, pops a wheelie, then SWOOPS DOWN the
          bluff towards her. She HOLLERS IN FEAR, then tries to
          WHACK HIM with her forked stick.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)

                    GET AWAY FROM ME--

          
          He SNATCHES it from her as he passes, KNOCKING HER to the
          ground. He SIDE-SKIDS his bike, hops off and JUMPS UP
          onto the stump. Looking TEN FEET TALL from the ground,
          THUNDER AND LIGHTNING at a peak, the Spy turns his THREE-
          EYED TURRET LENS and studies her like a predatory alien.

          
          And then, the thunder and lightning just FADE OUT and
          this psycho-killer, three-eyed spy pulls off his mask and
          Coraline GASPS -- he's just a short kid in a costume.

          
          Shoulders hunched, neck bent, the Spy - real name WYBIE
          LOVAT - aged 12 - examines Coraline's forked stick, aims
          it around.

          

                                 WYBIE

                           (OBLIVIOUS)
                    Hoo! Let me guess, you're from Texas or
                    Utah; someplace dried out and barren,
                    right? I heard about water-witching
                    before but it doesn't make sense; I mean,
                    it's just an ordinary branch.

          
          Coraline, SNATCHES it from his GLOVED HANDS.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (ENRAGED)

                    IT'S A DOWSING ROD!

          
          Coraline smacks Wybie.

          

                                   WYBIE
                    Ow!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    And I DON'T LIKE BEING STALKED, not by

                    PSYCHO-NERDS OR THEIR CATS!

          
          He crouches, nervous, to scratch the cat behind his ears.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    He's not really my cat; he's kinda feral
                    ? you know, wild? Of course, I do feed
                    him every night and sometimes he'll come
                    in my window `n bring me little dead
                    things.

          
          The cat PURRS like a diesel.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (TOUGH)
                    Look, I'm from Pontiac.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Huh?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    MICHIGAN? And if I'm a ""water witch"",

                    THEN--
                           (points stick, stomps foot)
                    --where's the secret WELL?

          

                                 WYBIE
                    You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it!

          
          Coraline reacts, hops out of the springy circle. The boy
          scrapes at the ground, revealing a CIRCULAR COVERING
          made of WOODEN PLANKS. He wedges a fallen branch under
          one side, and, using a rock for the fulcrum, pries up the
          covering.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    See? Supposed to be so deep if you fell
                    to the bottom and looked up, you'd see a
                    sky full of stars in the middle of the
                    day.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (SOFTENS)
                    Huh.

          
          Her frown RELAXES and the black cat tilts his head,
          noticing her change in tone. He steps off the branch, and
          the well cover thumps in place.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Surprised she let you move in...

          
          Jerks his head toward the pink house in distance.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    ... my Gramma. She owns the ""Pink Palace""
                           (indicates house in distance)
                    Won't rent to people with kids.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    What do you mean?

          

                                 WYBIE
                           (suddenly worried)
                    Uh... I'm not supposed to talk about it.

          
          Changing the subject, he lifts a gloved hand to shake.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    I'm Wybie, Wybie Lovat.

          

                                   CORALINE

                             (SKEPTICAL)
                    Wybie?

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Short for Wyborne. Not my idea, of
                    course. What'd you get saddled with?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I wasn't saddled with anything. It's
                    Coraline.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    Caroline what?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Coraline. Coraline Jones.

          

                                 WYBIE
                           (confused, not hearing it)
                    Hmmm... It's not real scientific, but I
                    heard an ordinary name, like Caroline --

          
          Her face goes as DARK as the rain clouds above.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    -- can lead people to have ordinary
                    expectations about a person--

          

                                 WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
                           (calling from afar)
                    Wyborne!

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I think I heard someone calling you,
                    Wyborne.

          

                                 WYBIE
                    What? I didn't hear anything--

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were-
                    you-born.

          
          A distant dinner bell clangs.

          

                                  WYBIE'S GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
                    Wyborne!

          

                                 WYBIE
                           (under his breath, nervous)
                    Grandma!

          
          He holds up his hands in surrender, nodding with eyes
          closed, forcing some laughs.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    Heh. Well, great to meet a Michigan
                    water witch.

          
          He picks up his bike, wheels it around, then holds up his
          gloved hands.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    But I'd wear gloves next time.

          

                                  CORALINE

                            (SKEPTICAL)
                    Why?

          
          He points to her dowsing rod, nods.

          

                                 WYBIE (CONT'D)
                    `Cause that dowsing rod of yours? Uh,
                    it's poison oak.

          

                                  CORALINE
                    Ehh!!

          
          Coraline drops the stick as he zooms away and wipes her
          hands on her clothes.

          
          The cat merows at her, shaking his head with a pitying
          look, then trots away after Wybie. She STICKS OUT HER
          TONGUE at him.

          
          She looks down at the COVERING to the well. Coraline
          finds a PEBBLE and drops it through A SMALL KNOT-HOLE.
          Ear at the knot-hole, she counts until there's a watery
          ""plop"" far below. FAT RAINDROPS start to fall around her.

          

                                                 ROTATE DISSOLVE TO:

          

          INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING


          
          It's POURING out. Coraline looks out a window at the DEAD-
          LOOKING GARDEN, and places PACKETS OF SEEDS - pumpkins,
          squash, snap dragons, bleeding hearts - on the sill.
          She's developed a REDDISH RASH - poison oak - on one
          hand.

          
          The main floor kitchen, like most   things in the Pink
          Palace, is barely maintained, and   looks worn and faded.
          Coraline's MOTHER, MEL JONES, 40,   bangs away at her
          laptop on the table, MOVING BOXES   stacked nearby. She's
          plain-looking and tired and wears   a NECK-BRACE.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.

          

                                 MEL
                           (not listening)
                    Uh huh.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I would have died.

          

                                 MEL
                           (continues typing)
                    That's nice.

          
          Coraline scratches the rash on her hand, changes subject.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's
                    perfect weather for gardening.

          

                                 MEL
                    No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a
                    mess.

          
          Coraline turns to her.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    But Mom, I want stuff growing when my
                    friends come to visit. Isn't that why we
                    moved here?

          

                                 MEL
                    Something like that. But then we had the
                    accident.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Wasn't my fault you hit that truck.

          

                                 MEL
                    I never said it was.

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (MUTTERS)
                    I can't believe it -- you and Dad get
                    paid to write about plants and you hate
                    dirt.

          
          Mel stops typing, loses her patience.

          

                                 MEL
                    Coraline, I don't have time for you right
                    now. And you still have unpacking to do.
                    Lots of unpacking.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    That sounds exciting.

          
          Mel remembers something.

          
                                 Mel (CONT'D)
                    Oh - some kid left this on the front
                    porch.

          
          Coraline walks over and is handed a NEWSPAPER-WRAPPED
          PACKAGE. Attached note reads:

          

                                 WYBIE (V.O.)
                    Hey Jonesy, look what I found in Gramma's
                    trunk. Look familiar? Wybie.

          
          She rips open the package and finds the BUTTON-EYED, BLUE-
          HAIRED, YELLOW RAINCOAT-WEARING DOLL from the head
          credits - it's a litte Coraline!

          

                                 CORALINE
                           (to herself)
                    Huh... a little me? That's weird.

          
          She crumples the note, both annoyed and charmed.

          

                                 MEL
                    What's his name, anyway?

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.

          
          But Coraline takes it with her and leaves the room.

          

          INT. STUDY - SAME


          
          CHARLIE Jones, 40, goose-necked and gangly with thinning
          dark hair, HUNT-AND-PECKS at his ancient computer,
          surrounded by boxes of GARDENING MAGAZINES and empty
          coffee cups. Coraline, with doll, opens the SQUEAKY DOOR.
          He doesn't turn.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Hey Dad, how's the writing going?... Dad?

          
          He ignores her reflection in his computer screen as he
          types away, green letters on black. She CLEARS HER

          THROAT.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    Hello, Coraline...
                           (notices doll's reflection)
                    And... Coraline doll?...

          

                                 CORALINE
                    D'you know where the garden tools are?

          
          He hears rain outside.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    It's pouring out there, isn't it.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Humph, it's just raining.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    What'd the boss say?

          

                                 CORALINE

                           (MOCKING)
                    ""Don't even think about going out,
                    Coraline Jones.""

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    Then you won't need the tools.

          
          Coraline GROANS, stamps her feet. Charlie just taps
          harder on the keys. Pouting, she makes the door squeak,
          opening and shutting it till he can't take any more. He
          spins around.

          

                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Uhhh, you know, this house is a hundred
                    and fifty years old.

          

                                   CORALINE
                    So?

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    So explore it!

          
          He grabs a pen and pad, holds it out.

          

                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                    Go out and ... count all the doors and
                    windows and write that down. List
                    everything blue!

                           (BEGGING)
                    Just let me work.

          
          She rolls her eyes, takes paper and pen and leaves.

          

          

          MONTAGE, VARIOUS - SAME

          

          HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS

          
          Coraline, with doll, jumps on BUMP in carpet that moves
          with each jump.

          

          LAUNDRY ROOM/WINTER GARDEN

          
          She wipes off the misted glass so she and the doll can
          see out, then writes in her pad: 7 leaky windows. A drop
          of water lands on the pad, smearing the ink. She adds
          really between 7 and leaky windows.

          

          HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS

          
          Coraline thumps the carpet bump again and pounds up the
          stairs.

          

          PARENT'S ROOM/BATHROOM

          
          A FRAMED PHOTO sits in the foreground on a beside table.
          It shows a younger, happier Coraline with her parents by
          the BEAR FOUNTAIN at the Detroit Zoo. RACK FOCUS to
          bedroom door as it swings into the room, with Coraline
          hanging on it. She drops to the ground and, doll and pad
          in hand, decides to check out the bathroom.

          
          When she pulls aside the mildewed shower curtain she
          finds a hundred skittering SILVERFISH BUGS.

          

                                    CORALINE
                    Ewww!

          
          Disgusted, she jumps into the tub and smashes as many as
          she can.

          
          She turns on the faucet to wash her hands, only to get
          soaked with rusty water from the shower head.

          

                                    CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Ahh!!

          
          She shakes out her hair.

          

          HALLWAY NEAR STAIRS

          
          Coraline pounds down the stairs, spots the carpet bump
          again in the hallway and jumps on it. A closet door
          opens, a light on inside, and she goes to investigate.

          

          WATER HEATER CLOSET

          
          ANGLE OVER water heater on Coraline. She jots down one
          rusty water heater in her pad. As she leaves, she flicks
          off the light switch, not noticing a note taped beside it
          that says: Do not turn off!

          

          

          INT. STUDY - SAME


          
          Lights flicker and then Charlie's computer dies. He
          hollers.

          

                                 CHARLIE
                    No, no, no, no, no; GAAAA--!

          

          

          INT. HALLWAY - SAME


          

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)

                    --AAAAAAA!

          
          Coraline reacts with guilty alarm, runs back to the
          closet and --

          

          

          INT. CLOSET - SAME


          
          -- spots the Do not turn off note. She flips the light
          switch back on and gets out of there.

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          The room is faded and cold with bare windows looking out
          on rain and gray. The floor is strewn with moving boxes,
          a few pieces of furniture, Charlie's old Nordic Track. A
          few garden tools lean against one wall; a cardboard
          mattress box leans against a corner wall.

          
          Coraline enters, counting windows and doors to note in
          her pad. She sets the doll on a low table beside an open
          moving box and smiles.

          
          The box is filled with her mom's collection of
          SNOWGLOBES. She takes out her favorite - the BEAR
          FOUNTAIN AT THE DETROIT ZOO - and shakes it. She studies
          the globe and sighs with homesickness. She sets it
          carefully on the FIREPLACE MANTEL, then unwraps the rest
          of the snowglobes and places them beside it.

          
          Over the mantel hangs a PAINTING of a CRYING BOY IN BLUE -
          a scoop of ice cream melting on his shirt, his hand
          holding an EMPTY CONE. Coraline takes up pad and pen and
          adds to her list, muttering aloud.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    One boring blue boy in a painfully boring
                    painting ... four incredibly boring
                    windows ... and no... more... doors...

          
          She turns to grab the doll off the table by the snow
          globe box. It's gone.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    All right, little me, where are you
                    hiding?

          
          Scanning the room, she spots the doll LOOKING OUT FROM
          BEHIND THE MATTRESS BOX leaned against the corner wall.
          Perplexed, she walks over and kneels down to grab the
          doll when she notices SOMETHING ON THE WALL behind the
          box.

          
          She shoves the box aside, and discovers the outline of a
          SMALL DOOR that's been wallpapered over.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Huh?

          
          Intensely curious, she calls to the kitchen.

          

                                 CORALINE (CONT'D)
                    Hey Mom...

          

          

          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS


          
          Mom, typing away, ignores her.

          

                                 CORALINE (O.S.)
                    Where does this door go?

          

                                 MEL
                    I'm really, really busy!

          

          INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          
          Coraline tries to open it but there's no handle.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    I think it's locked.

          

                                    MEL (O.S.)

          

          

          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS


          

                                 CORALINE (O.S.)
                    Pleeeeeeeeease!

          
          Mel gets up, really annoyed. Big sigh.

          

                                    MEL
                    Uhhh...

          

          

          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          She walks over to Coraline, looks at the outline of the
          door in the ratty old wallpaper.

          

                                  MEL
                    Will you stop pestering me if I do this
                    for you?

          
          Coraline nods her head quickly, PANTING like a dog.

          

                                    MEL (CONT'D)
                    Fine.

          
          She heads back to the kitchen.

          

          

          INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          
          Mel pulls open a drawer, pushes a bunch of loose brass
          and nickel keys aside to find a small, sharp black key.
          Holds it up.

          

          

          INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          
          Mel cuts the wallpaper around the door and sticks the key
          in the lock. Coraline looks on, giddy with anticipation,
          the doll at her side. Mel turns the key, unlocks the
          door, and pulls it open to reveal ... an UNBROKEN BRICK
          WALL. Coraline is totally disappointed.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    Bricks? I don't get it.

          
          Coraline scratches her wrist rash with annoyance.

          

                                 MEL
                    They must have closed this off when they
                    divided up the house.

          
          Mel gets up to leave.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You're kidding? And why is the door so
                    small?

          
          Mel leaving room, turns back, and loses it.

          

                                 MEL
                    We made a deal. ZIP IT!

          
          She exits. Coraline makes annoyed sound.

          

                                 CORALINE
                    You didn't lock it.

          

                                  MEL (O.S.)
                    AaaaaH!!!

          
          Coraline pushes the little door shut, her head lowered.

          

          

          EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT


          
          WIDE ANGLE ON HOUSE. Pouring rain. We hear Charlie
          singing a song about Coraline, badly.

                         FADE IN:
                         
          A cave painting of the Dreamworks logo. Push past the
          moon to the sun. Bright. Beautiful. The sun DISSOLVES
                         TO:

                         
          Cave paintings of a family of cavemen -- we will come to
          know them as The Croods.
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           With every sun comes a new day. A new
           beginning. A hope that things will be
           better today than they were yesterday.
                         
          The Croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for
          food. Scared. Fast.
                         
          The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They
          escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           But not for me. My name's Eep. This, is
           my family, the Croods. If you weren't
           clued in already by the animal skins and
           sloping foreheads - we're cavemen. Most
           days we spend in our cave, in the dark.
           Night after night, day after day. Yep.
           Home sweet home. When we did go out, we
           struggled to find food in a harsh and
           hostile world. And I struggled to
           survive my family.
                         
          The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They
          escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.

                          EEP (V.O.)
           We were the last ones around. There used
           to be neighbors. The Gorts, smashed by a
           mammoth. The Horks, swallowed by a sand
           snake. The Erfs, mosquito bite. Throgs,
           common cold. And, the Croods. That's
           us. The Croods made it...
                         
          Grug protects his family from a GIANT BEAR OWL.
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           Because of my Dad. He was strong... and
           he followed the rules.
                         
          A shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his
          family home.

          2.
                         
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           ... the ones painted on the cave walls.
           Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad,
           going out at night is bad. Basically,
           anything fun is bad. Welcome to my
           world.
                         
          They all run back into the cave where Grug slams the rock
          door closed.
                         
          SLOWLY LIGHT ON CAVE PAINTINGS COMES UP AGAIN. But this
          time the light casts an ominous tone.
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           But this is a story about how all that
           changed in an instant.
                         
          RAPID SHOTS OF THE GREAT SPLIT CUTTING THROUGH THE LAND.

          SHOTS OF CATACLYSM. CUT FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL...
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           Because what we didn't know, was that our
           world was about to come to an end. And
           there were no rules on our cave walls to
           prepare us for that.
                         
          CAVEMAN HANDS PRESS against the rock wall. They PUSH. A
          BLINDING LIGHT FLOODS the screen.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          SEQ. 100 - MEET THE CROODS
          A HUGE CAVEMAN, GRUG, RUSHES forward, screaming,
          growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a THREAT
          DISPLAY. He BLINKS in the bright morning light. He
          LIFTS and HURLS a large boulder.
                         
                          GRUG
           Raaaaar grooooOOOOoooowwwll ERF ERF
           Glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh!
                         
          As suddenly as he began, Grug stops. Panting, he waits
          for the echoes of his outburst to fade.
                         
          Grug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a
          signal, but before any sound escapes his lips--
                         
          A CAVE GIRL, EEP, bursts from the cave.
          3.
                         
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           You're supposed to wait for my signal
           Eep. Eep?
                         
          Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away. They pounce on
          Grug briefly before scampering off. Eep spreads out on
          an overhanging rock. She BASKS IN THE SUN.
                         
                          EEP
           We've been in that cave forever.
                         
                          GRUG
           Three days is not forever.
                         
                          EEP
           It is with this family.
                         
                          GRUG
           Eep would you come down here? You're
           being so dramatic.
                         
          A LITTLE GIRL, SANDY, charges out next. Her display is
          more terrier-like.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           No, no, no Sandy, come back here.
           Remember the signal. Good girls wait for
           the signal.
                         
          A CAVE WOMAN, UGGA, scrambles out next. She is mostly
          focused on catching Sandy, giving only cursory effort to
          her display.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Ugga.
                          UGGA
           As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in,
           and you can give the signal.
                         
                          GRUG
           No, I mean, you're already out now.
                         
           THUNK (O.S.)
           I am waiting for the signal, dad.
                         
          We HEAR the voice of Grug's nine-year-old son from inside
          the cave. THUNK is eager to please his dad and emulates
          his every move.
                         
                          GRUG
           Never mind, Thunk. Just, come out.
          4.
                         
                         
                          THUNK
           (not so fast)
           Uhh, but if you don't give the signal,
           how do I know you're my dad?
                         
                          GRUG
           The signal isn't so you know it's me,
           it's so you know I wasn't eaten by an
           animal.
                         
          Beat.
                         
                          THUNK
           Then why is the signal an animal noise?
           I mean, doesn't that just confuse things?
                         
          Grug sighs.
                         
                          THUNK (CONT'D)
           I don't know... I'm still waiting for the
           signal.
                         
                          GRUG
           Sigh. Hoo hooooo! Hoo hooooo!
                         
          Thunk comes out growling, and barrels into Grug. Thunk
          picks up a boulder and throws it. It ricochets off the
          cliff wall and careens into Grug. Grug gets plowed over
          by the boulder.
                         
                          UGGA
           Mom, we're ready to leave.
                          (BEAT)
           Mom!
                         
          Grug sits up and smiles.
                          GRAN
           Still alive!
                         
          Grug's face drops.
                         
                          GRUG
           It's still early.
                         
                          GRAN
           And you're still fat.
                         
                          GRUG
           Breakfast formation!
                         
          The Croods form up in a flying wedge, with Grug in the
          lead.
          5.

           I want to see some real caveman action
           out there. We do this fast. We do this
           loud, we do this as a family and never
           not be afraid. Go!

          EXT. MOUTH OF CROOD CANYON - MORNING
                         
          Grug and the Croods come to a stop at the HUNTING
          GROUNDS. They are spent from a fifteen-mile run.
                         
                          THUNK
                          (HUFFING)
           Yeah... breakfast...
                         
          We see a nest with a huge unguarded blue egg. The Croods
          take shelter behind a rock. Grug PEERS over the top.
                         
                          GRUG
           Who's up?
                         
          Eep's hand SHOOTS up. Thunk is less than enthusiastic.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           We'll flip for it.
                         
          Grug LIFTS Gran on his hand, and FLIPS her up in the air.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Call her in the air.

          Gran FACE-PLANTS, her head buried in the sand. Only her

          The family fades back and splits up. They get into
          fighting/running position.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Ok. Thunk. Go. Come on Thunk.
                         
          Thunk BREAKS COVER. He dashes into the open, SNATCHES
          the egg.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Hah! Way to go. Take it to the cave!
                         
          Thunk PASSES Grug and makes a bee-line for Crood Canyon.
                         
          A Gerf bird smashes Thunk and steals the egg back.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Oooh!
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Release the baby.
                         
          Eep and Sandy MOVE IN on the bird. Sandy NIPS at its
          heels while UGGA CLIMBS up onto its head. She PULLS the
          egg from its beak.
                         
          Down range, TRIP GERBILS SURFACE. They STRETCH their
          shared tail across the Ramu's path like an arresting
          cable on a carrier.
                         
          Ugga RISES to THROW the egg to Grug - the gerbils WRAP
          their tail around the Ramu like a bola. The Ramu GOES
          DOWN hard. Ugga and the egg ROLL forward. The Trip
          Gerbils SNATCH up the egg and make off with it.
                         
                          UGGA
           Get um Mom! Do it for the Croods!
                         
          Gran's cane HOOKS the gerbils in the middle of their tail
          and WHIPS them up and over her shoulder.
                         
                         ON GRAN
                         
          DRIBBLING the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey
          player. LIYOTES POP UP from behind hoodoos. They SWARM
          in behind her.
                         
          The Liyotes TRIP Gran. They steal the egg, and HIT THE
          GAS. They are INCREDIBLY FAST.
                         
                          GRAN

          Crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on
          the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights. Eep
          LAUNCHES.
                         
          Eep runs after the Liyote with the egg, cutting him off
          in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg
          into the air. Eep leaps into the air taking back the egg.
                         
                          EEP
           Thanks!
                         
          A bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her. She
          loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug.
                         
                          GRUG
           Eep!
                         
                          EEP
           Heads Up!
                         
          Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small
          cave. Thunk following close behind accidentally trips
          over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the
          ground and fumbling the egg once again.
                         
          Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down
          on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks.
          The family members meet up as they begin their long run
          back to the cave.
                         
          An entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head
          back to their cave.
                         
          The Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the
          chase.
                         
          Grug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each
          family member onto the Girelephant's back.
                         
          Grug dodges the BearOwl's attack and uses him as a
          launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant.
                         
          Thunk is happy to see Dad is safe.
                         
                          THUNK
           Oh hey Dad, can we eat now?
                         
                          GRUG
           Just wait till we get home. Eep put on
           the brakes.
                         
          The entrance to Crood canyon appears on the horizon.

          Eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as Grug takes
          over the other. Together they dig their heels into the
          ground, slowing down the Girelephant.
                         
          The Bearowl continues the chase. The Croods maneuver the
          Girelephant to fend off the Bearowl.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Eep!
                         
          The Girelephant moving way too fast readies for the
          crash. The Girelephant crashes into the entrance of the
          canyon, sending the Croods flying in. They all tumble.
          Grug makes an extraordinary football catch. He holds
          tight to the meal as he slams into a rock. Grug holds up
          the egg.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Who's hungry?
                         
                          THUNK
           Alright! Good one, dad!
                         
                          GRUG
           Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.
                         
          Grug tosses the egg to Thunk, Thunk fumbles it and it
          cracks open.
                         
                          THUNK
           Sorry, dad.
                         
                          UGGA
           Looks like fast food tonight!
                         
          The family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each
          Crood gets a taste. Thunk is the last Crood to get a
          mouthful, he hands it over to Grug-- the egg is empty.
                         
                          GRUG
           That's alright. I ate last week.
                         
          A SHADOW TOUCHES Grug's feet. He looks up - the sun is
          setting behind the canyon wall. He HOLDS UP his hand to
          gauge how much daylight is left.

          a sound in the distance. Curious, she begins to climb
          even higher. Grug leaves the cave, searching for her.

           Come on.
                         
          Behind Grug, the Bear Owl appears up the canyon. It
          SPOTS Grug and the open cave and RACES to attack. Grug
          sees the BearOwl in full attack mode.

                          GRUG
           That was too close!
                         
                          EEP
           I was watching. I was fine.
                         
                          GRUG
           What were you doing up there, Eep?
                         
                          EEP
           I don't know.
                         
                          GRUG
           What were you looking for?
                         
                          EEP
           Nothing.
                         
                          GRUG
           Well then why did you go up there?
                         
                          EEP
                          (ANNOYED)
           I don't know.
                          GRUG
           Why don't you know? Stop looking for
           things. Fear keeps us alive Eep. Never
           not be afraid.
                         
          Eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where
          a tiny spot of light seeps in.
                         
                          EEP
                          (TO HERSELF)
           What's the point of all this?
                         
                          GRUG
           Hmmm? What was that?

                          EEP
           (a little louder)
           I mean, why are we here? What are we
           doing this for?

           No one said survival was fun.
                         
                          EEP
           Nothing is fun.
                         
                          GRUG
           Hmm? Would you come down here. Eep?
                         
          No answer. Grug CLIMBS up. Ugga PULLS Grug back down.
                         
                          UGGA
           Grug. Off.
                         
                          GRUG
           Yes.
                         
          Grug climbs back up.
                         
                          UGGA
           Off!
                         
                          GRUG
           I just don't see why she needs her own
           ledge. That's all. That's what this is
           about.
                         
                          UGGA
           She's working through some things and
           needs her own space.
                         
                          GRUG
           What things? How long is this going to
           take? Really? I mean she already
           doesn't listen to me.
                         
          A pebble hits Grug in the head. It came from Eep's
          ledge.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Hey!
                         
                          UGGA
           See? She's listening.
          13.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           If she wants to survive, she has to
           follow our rules.
                         
                          UGGA
           How about a story? Eep loves those.
                         
          Grug brightens.
                         
                          GRUG
                          (BRIGHTENING)
           That's a good idea ... How about a story,
           huh?
                         
                          THUNK
           Oh yeah, tell us a story.
                         
          The Croods minus Eep gather in a semi-circle on the
          ground. Grug retrieves Sandy and her Krispy Bear from
          the bone-crib.
                         
                          GRUG
           Ok. Can I borrow that? Thank you. Eep!
           Your old favorite?
                         
                          EEP
           I haven't played with that thing in
           years.
                         
                          GRUG
           Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy
           Bear.
                         
          Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join, but she stays
          put.
          As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall
          of the cave.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           A long time ago, this little bear was
           alive. She was alive because she
           listened to her father and lived her life
           in routine and darkness and terror. So
           she was happy. But Krispy had one,
           terrible problem. She was filled with...
           curiosity.
                         
                          UGGA
           Grug!
                         
          Ugga covers Sandy's ears.
          14.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           Yes. And one day, while she was in a
           tree, the curious little bear wanted to
           climb to the top.
                         
                          THUNK
           Wha?
                         
                          GRUG
           And no sooner than she climbed to the
           top, she saw something new and died.
                         
          Grug SWATS the painting.
                         
                          THUNK
           Just like that?
                         
                          GRUG
           Yes! Her last moments of terror still
           frozen on her face.
                         
          Grug holds out Krispy Bear. The family is terrified.
                         
                          GRAN
           Oh, same ending as everyday.

           I get it, dad. I get it. I will never
           do anything new or different.
                         
                          GRUG
           Good man, Thunk.
                         
          Pan across the walls to reveal they are covered with
          stories all seemingly with the same ending.
                          UGGA
           Alright, everyone sharpen your teeth and
           let's pile up.
                         
          All their worst fears confirmed, the Croods snuggle into
          one big heap, warm and comfy. Grug casts a glance to
          Eep's ledge. She doesn't budge.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK:

          INT. CROOD CAVE - NIGHT
                         
          The Croods sleep peacefully in their pile. Except Eep,
          who tosses restlessly on her LEDGE. Outside, we hear the
          ROARS and HOWLS of prehistoric creatures fighting.
                         
          But then, SILENCE.
                         
          And then cutting through the primordial night is a
          MUSICAL SOUND. Unsettling. Unearthly. Eep creeps
          around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the
          ""door"" to peer outside, when suddenly--
                         
          WHOOSH! A bright light blazes through the gaps around
          the boulder door, bathing Eep in an OTHER-WORLDLY GLOW.
          She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to
          catch it in her hands.
                         
          Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to
          get a look at what is outside, but she can't get more
          than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the
          disappearing light.
                         
          Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the
          cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs. Slowly, she
          shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. It takes
          all of her strength, but she manages to move it just
          enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out.
                         
          EXT. CROOD CANYON - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Eep stands outside at night for the first time ever. Her
          heart races. The hot night wind blows against her face
          and through her hair. The forbidden sensation is
          exhilarating.
          The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it
          will be gone in another few seconds. With one of her
          hands pressed tightly to the cave `door', she steels
          herself.
                         
          Eep LETS GO and DASHES after the light, SCRAMBLING
          through the SANDSTONE NARROWS, bounding from side to
          side. As she disappears into the darkness of the canyon,
          we...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. CANYON
                         
          The light ahead is growing brighter. Eep is closing on
          it. In her excitement, she missteps and SNAPS a stick
          underfoot.
          16.
                         
                         
          It was barely audible. Eep instinctively FREEZES.
                         
          A huge SHADOW of a TUSKED CREATURE is cast on the wall
          above her. Eep throws a rock at the shadow.
                         
          She POWERS STRAIGHT UP the stone wall with unexpected
          speed.
                         
          The Creature RUNS. Eep tops the wall and...
                         
                          CUT TO:

          EXT. ROCK ARCH - NIGHT
                         
          Eep steps into a small clearing. Stuck in the ground, is
          a TORCH. As far as Eep knows, this is the thing she was
          following. Eep crouches down and cautiously approaches.
                         
          REVERSE ANGLE - Eep can feel the heat from the fire on
          the palms of her hands and her face. TENSE. EXCITING.
                         
          But camouflaged against the rock wall behind her,
          something MOVES. A WARTHOG CREATURE stands upright and
          creeps up behind her.
                         
          Eep reaches out to TOUCH the flame. The torch blows away
          from her. The wind has changed direction. The breeze at
          her back, Eep smells the Creature behind her. On her
          face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs
          the creature. She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder.
          It hits the torch, knocking it to the ground. Eep jumps
          back, GRABBING a good-sized rock - she's poised to bash
          the Creature's brains in.
                         
                          CREATURE
           Nuh! Nuh!
                         
          The Creature defensively raises its arms, hands in front
          of its face.
                         
                          GUY
           No!
                         
          Hands? Eep GASPS, shocked to see HUMAN HANDS attached to
          this monstrosity.
                         
          The Creature slowly puts his hands to"

   Snow and ice as far as the eye can see. What looks like a
   windowless MILITARY BASE surrounded by barbed wire fences
   sits in the middle of the wasteland.

   TITLE CARD: TOP SECRET RESEARCH LABORATORY.   ARCTIC CIRCLE.

   At the GUARD GATE, two RUSSIAN GUARDS play poker using an
   overturned barrel as a table.

   Russian Guard 1 shows a five of diamonds... and four Aces.
   The other Guard folds. Russian Guard 1 LAUGHS and drags in
   the pile of coins.

   While he SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN and does a celebratory dance, the
   coins fly up into the air. Russian Guard 1 stops dancing and
   sees that the coins are gone. He accuses the other Guard of
   stealing them. Russian Guard 2 swears he didn't take them.

   Russian Guard 1 grabs a shovel and wields it menacingly,
   until it flies up into the air. They both look up to see
   where it's gone. Then the metal barrel they were using as a
   table flies up, knocking them over.

   Russian Guard 2 looks up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNET SHIP
   LOWERING DOWN FROM ABOVE AND HOVERING OVER THE LABORATORY.

   A watchtower guard shouts. A door below opens as a bunch of
   Guards run out and point their guns at the magnet ship.
   Then...WOOSH! All of their guns are pulled up towards the
   ship, including the guards themselves, who are strapped to
   their guns.

   A SNOWMOBILE lifts off the ground and flies up to the magnet.
   Other vehicles and small buildings begin to pull away from
   the ground.

   Then--

   THE ENTIRE LAB STARTS TO GET PULLED UP OUT OF THE GROUND.

   CLANK! The lab makes contact with the ship. It flies up and
   down, shaking the scientists and guards off. They fall to
   the ground. The magnet ship flies away with their lab,
   vehicles, and weapons.

   The remaining guards and scientists are strewn across the
   snow with the remnants of the damaged base. We see a porta-
   potty door open. A Confused Guard is sitting on the can
   reading a newspaper, having missed the entire incident. He
   closes the door.

   SECURITY FOOTAGE of the research station named PX LABS being

EXT: SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Gru steps toward camera, holding some sort of menacing gun,
which he loads and cocks. He pulls the trigger, which shoots
out an inflatable unicorn balloon.

Smiling, he ties it to the windowsill next to some others.



EXT: GRU'S BACKYARD - DAY

A banner reads: ""Happy Birthday Agnes!"" and a massive
backyard party is in full swing. The yard is decorated with
pink balloons and streamers, and a BOUNCY HOUSE shaped like a
castle.

AGNES and several other LITTLE GIRLS slide down a slide.
They are all dressed as princesses, but Agnes is dressed as a
princess riding a unicorn.

                    AGNES
          This is the best party EVER!!!

Edith, dressed as a ninja, emerges from beneath a table and
climbs across the monkey bars as a series of jousts, blades,
and boxing gloves come up from the ground underneath her.
She jumps down, narrowly avoiding a bear trap.

                     EDITH
          Haha!   Yeah!
          DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT       3.


Two LITTLE GIRLS fish in a small kiddie pool. One of the
girls pulls up a toy duck and then razzes the other girl, but
then a LIVE PIRANHA jumps out and eats the toy duck.

A BOY and a GIRL sword fight. The Boy does a bunch of fancy
moves. The Girl waits for him to finish and then pounds him
on the head with a club.

Two kids in the background are on a see-saw made of bombs.
Agnes runs into the middle of the yard and points offscreen.

                     AGNES
          Oh no!   A dragon is approaching!

All of the kids turn and see KYLE dressed as a dragon. He
GRUMBLES and then they SCREAM and huddle around Agnes. Then
Margo enters wearing a SUIT OF ARMOR and wielding a SWORD.

                    MARGO
          Fear not, for here come the gallant
          knights to save us!

She gestures to a group of minions wearing tiny suits of
armor and wielding various MEDIEVAL WEAPONS. The Kids CHEER
as the minions charge toward Kyle. One accidentally hits
another with his sword. A fight ensues in which they use the
medieval weapons on each other.

One minion pounds another with a MACE. One Minion wanders off
from the fight with his helmet on backwards, wildly swinging
his mace.

Across the yard, Gru is busy grilling burgers and talking on
the phone. Not happy.

                    GRU
          No, no, no! What do you mean she's
          not coming?! I have a backyard
          full of these little girls who are
          counting on a visit from a fairy
          princess!

The mace-swinging Minion walks by and accidently, repeatedly
hits Gru with the mace in the shin.

                     GRU (CONT'D)
          Ah!   Hurts! Ah! Stop it!

Gru kicks the minion's helmet and chases him off with a
spatula, sending him towards the party swinging his mace.
Gru SIGHS and returns to the call.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Listen! I don't want a refund! I
          want a fairy princess... please!
          Please, I am begging you.
              (Resigned)
          You know what? I hope that you can
          sleep at night, you crusher of
          little girls' dreams!!!

Gru hits the phone with his spatula and hangs up.    Turns and
sees Agnes standing there.

                     AGNES
          Ooh ooh!   When's the Fairy Princess
          coming?

Gru stares down at Agnes' big excited eyes. He opens his
mouth to tell her the truth, but can't do it.

                    GRU
          Any minute now!

Agnes squeals with excitement and runs off.

                     AGNES
          Yayyy!

Gru looks worried--what do I do now?    He signals two minions.

                    GRU
          Stall them.


EXT: BACKYARD - LATER

A hand-painted piece of cardboard reading ""THE MAGIC SHOW"" is
placed on an easel. Agnes and all of the little kids sit in
a semicircle on the grass. Two minions dressed as magicians
are doing a magic act with Edith as their assistant. One
minion blows up a balloon and puts it in Edith's mouth. Then
the other whips out a CHAINSAW and fires it up, heading
toward her.

Margo sees this and quickly intervenes.

                    MARGO
          Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, alright.
          That's enough of the magic show!

The minions don't hide their disappointment.

                     MINIONS
          Awwww.
          DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   5.


Margo suddenly looks around as if she just heard something.

                    MARGO
          Wait, did you hear that? It
          sounded like the twinkling sounds
          of magical fairy dust.

                    AGNES
              (gasps)
          It's the fairy princess!   She's
          coming!

Margo gasps and points up to the sky.

                      MARGO
          Look!

Edith spits out her magic balloon in horror and we follow it
up to reveal--

Gru. Dressed in a PUFFY PINK DRESS, fairy wings, glittery
eyelashes and tiara and magical wand.

Up on top of Gru's house, the minions struggle to lower him
down on a rope. Edith's balloon floats by and distracts
them.

They let go of the rope and Gru swings wildly, smashing into
the wall of the house and crashing to the ground.

                      GRU
          Aaaaaahh!

He stands up and tries to cover.

Agnes SIGHS HAPPILY, in awe of the fairy princess.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
              (in falsetto)
          It is I, Gru...zinkerbell! The
          most magical fairy princess of all!
          And I am here to wish Princess
          Agnes a very happy birthday!

Gru sprinkles the girls with glitter and they continue to
stare, frozen. Then a LITTLE GIRL raises her hand and speaks
with a lisp.

                    LITTLE GIRL
          How come you're tho fat?

Gru grits his teeth, then forces a smile and speaks with a
high-pitched, dreamy voice.

                    GRU
          Because my house is made of candy
          and sometimes I eat instead of
          facing my problems.

The girl starts to ask another question.

                    LITTLE GIRL
          How come you have-

Gru cuts her off with a puff of fairy dust to the face.   She
COUGHS.

                     GRU
          Okay!   Time for cake!

As the kids run to the table, Agnes approaches Gru.

                    AGNES
          Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell. You're
          the best fairy princess ever!

Gru smiles.

                    GRU
              (in falsetto)
          You are welcome, little girl.

She runs off, but quickly returns.

                    AGNES
              (whispers in his ear)
          I know it's really you, Gru. I'm
          just pretending for the other kids.

She runs off again to join her friends. Gru watches her go.
Couldn't be happier. Then he is approached by JILLIAN, a
heavily-Botoxed mom.

                    JILLIAN
          Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the
          Party!

                    GRU
              (forcing a smile)
          Hello, Jillian.

                    JILLIAN
          Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb
          here, but my friend Natalie is
          recently single, and...
           DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   7.


In the background, a homely NATALIE leans against a buffet
table and seductively raises her eyebrows at Gru. The table
collapses to the ground beneath her.

                     GRU
               (realizes what's going on)
           No, no, no, get off of the limb
           right now. No limb.

                     JILLIAN
           Oh, come on...she's a riot. She
           sings karaoke, she has a lot of
           free time, looks aren't that
           important to her...

In the background, Natalie inadvertently walks in front of a
bottle pitch game, is struck by a ball, and falls to the
ground.

                     GRU
           No, Jill's, that is not happening.
           Seriously. I'm fine.

                     JILLIAN
               (calling after Gru)
           Okay, fine. Forget Natalie.        How
           about my cousin Linda?

Gru walks off, passing by Edith and Margo.

                        GRU
           No.

                     JILLIAN
           Oh, oh! I know someone whose
           husband just died!

SPLASH!   Suddenly Jillian is sprayed in the face with water.

Reveal Gru holding a HOSE with a SPRAY NOZZLE.

                        GRU
           I'm sorry.     I did not see you
           there.

SPLASH!   He sprays her again.    She falls down.

                        GRU (CONT'D)
           Or there.

He drops the hose and walks away, CHUCKLING softly.

EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - DUSK

Gru takes Kyle out to the front yard.

CAMERA POV

A camera with nightvision is watching them. The screen
analyzes Kyle and a readout comes out as ""SPECIES: UNKNOWN.""
Kyle sniffs Gru's flowers.

                       GRU
             Kyle... Kyle!

Then it analyzes Gru and the readout says ""TARGET ACQUIRED.""

                       GRU (CONT'D)
             Ky--Kyle!   No, do not do your
             business on the petunias!

Kyle lifts up his leg next to Gru's flowers.

He picks Kyle up and places him next to his neighbor's bush.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
             There you go. Those are Fred's.
             Go crazy.

Kyle does and the bush immediately withers and dies.         Gru
CHUCKLES.

                         GRU (CONT'D)
             Good boy.

                         VOICE (O.S.)

Gru turns and sees Lucy Wilde standing there.

             Wha?   I didn't... What... Yes?

             Oh. Whoops.

Gru whips out his FREEZE RAY and fires it.       A WALL OF ICE
heads for Lucy.

But before it gets to her, Lucy pulls out a retractable gun
from her purse, which acts as a FLAMETHROWER. Melting the
ice.

                    LUCY
          You know you really should announce
          your weapons after you fire them,
          Mr. Gru. For example--

She pulls out a LIPSTICK. Fires it at Gru. The tip flies
through the air and connects with his chest, latching on.
ZZZZZAPPP! It tases him, which sends his body flailing in
different funny poses before passing out.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Lipstick Taser! Oh, it works so
          good.


EXT: STREET - LATER

Lucy tries to drag Gru to her car, but he's too heavy.

                         LUCY
          Man.    Ugh.     Large...person.

She gets an idea.

Lucy gets into her car. In the background, we see Gru begin
to come to, but he is struck by Lucy's car as she pulls back
and is knocked out again.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Oh...sorry!

Closer now, Lucy gets out and stuffs his body into the trunk.

Just then Tom and Stuart come out of Gru's garage and see
their boss being loaded in. Lucy struggles to close the
trunk.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Get...in...there...you...big...man!

SLAM! Lucy finally slams the trunk then quickly gets into
the vehicle.

Tom and Stuart exchange horrified looks.

They take off running after the car as it pulls away, running
as fast as their tiny legs will carry them. They get right
behind it and Tom LEAPS up onto the trunk. He reaches his
hand out to Stuart, who is falling behind.

                    TOM
          Koom ey lah!

                    STUART
          Koom ey lah! Koom ey lah!

Stuart leaps for the bumper and Tom catches him by his
overall straps. Tom holds on tight as Stuart dangles from
the back of the car, his overall straps stretching way out.

                    STUART (CONT'D)
          Aaaaaaiiieeeaaaiiieeeaaaah!

As Lucy turns a corner, he slams into some garbage cans and
ends up skiing behind the car in a cardboard box.

Now in the box, Stuart continues to ride behind the car, and
even starts to get the hang of that, too. He waves at Tom,
and Tom waves back.

                    STUART (CONT'D)
          Woooo!

                    TOM
          Ooooh!

All is good until they go past a clothesline and a sheet gets
stuck on Stuart.

The sheet forms a parasail which lifts Stuart up into the
air. He strikes a Superman flying pose. Then a flock of
GEESE fly toward him and one actually slams into his face.

                    STUART
          Quack quack!

It SQUAWKS at him as it flies off.

Lucy spots the commotion in her side view mirror and slams on
the brakes. SCREECH! Both minions fly forward--

Lucy sees this, drives forward, and opens the convertible
top, causing the Minions to land right in the passenger's

Lucy's car continues driving until it reaches a crowded PIER.
And doesn't stop. It drives right off the end of the pier.
A confused fisherman leaps for his life.

INT: OCEAN - SAME

Lucy's car now transforms into an UNDERWATER VEHICLE. As the
minions come to, one of them tries playing with the radio
until Lucy slaps his hand away. They speed through the sea
and an octopus slams into her windshield. She turns on the
wipers, which hits the octopus in the face until he's had
enough and swims off in a cloud of ink.

She HONKS her HORN as she passes through a school of fish.

                        MINIONS
           Whoa...

As the fish pass the Minions look ahead to see a shark
heading for them with his mouth open. They SCREAM. Lucy
quickly steers the car out of harm's way. They pass by
several more sharks until they arrive at a GIANT SUBMARINE
with the letters ""AVL"" on the side.

A HATCH opens and Lucy's car goes inside.       The hatch closes
behind her.

is ejected from the trunk.

          serum. What is PX-41, you ask?
          Mmmm, it's pretty bad... Look.

A LABCOAT TECHNICIAN approaches the bunny with a SYRINGE
containing the purple liquid. Injects some in its butt.

                     TOM AND STUART
          Aaah!

Instantly the bunny transforms into a HIDEOUS PURPLE MONSTER
BUNNY. Gru and the Minions smile, impressed.

Then it goes crazy and attacks the scientist.    Gru covers his
eyes and the Minions pass out.

                     GRU
          Oh!

The bunny attacks the technician, then the camera...and the
film is over.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Hmm, you usually don't see that in
          bunnies.

                     SILAS
          As you can see, in the wrong hands,
          the PX-41 serum could be the most
          devastating weapon on earth.
              (struggles to get through
                the opening in the table)
          Fortunately it has a very distinct
          chemical footprint, and using the
          latest chemtracking technology, we
          found traces of it in the Paradise
          Mall.

On the screens we see images depicting a highly technical
diagram of the shopping mall.

                     GRU
          Ha!   A mall?

                    SILAS
          Precisely. And we believe that one
          of these shop owners is a master
          criminal.

Silas scrolls through pictures of the mall's shop owners.

                    SILAS (CONT'D)
          And that's where you come in. As
          an ex-villain, you know how a
          villain thinks, how a villain acts.

                    LUCY
          The plan is to set you up
          undercover at a shop in the mall,
          where hopefully you'll be able to--

                    GRU
          Okay, I see where this is going,
          with all the Mission Impossible
          stuff, but no. No! I am a father
          now. And a legitimate businessman.
          I am developing a line of delicious
          jams and jellies.

Silas shoots him a look.    He CHUCKLES.

                    SILAS
          Jams and...jellies?

                     GRU
          Oh, attitude! That's right! So
          thanks, but no thanks.
              (beat)
          And here's a tip--instead of tasing
          people and kidnapping them, maybe
          you should just give them a call!
          Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt!

              (chuckles)
          Oh, yeah, like that's any better!

Gru turns and heads for the door, followed by Tom and Stuart,
who continue to GIGGLE about Ramsbottom's name.

          Look, I probably shouldn't be
          saying this, but your work as a

She hands Gru her BUSINESS CARD.   Gru takes it and stares at
it.

Gru rows back to shore as Tom yells to him like a coxswain.

Gru stares back at Edith.     Gets a far-away look in his eyes.


EXT: PLAYGROUND - FLASHBACK - DAY

We flash back to LITTLE GRU on the school playground. He
stares, lovesick, at a CUTE LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, named LISA.

                    LISA
              (to her friends)
          Hey, did you guys see the moon
          landing on TV?

                    LISA
          Yeah, and you know what--

Gru approaches her.

                    LITTLE GRU
          Excuse me, Lisa?

But she doesn't notice him.    He tries again.

                     LISA
               (to her friends)
          I was talking to Billy the other
          day.

          No way.

                    LISA
          He is so cute.

Gru clears his throat.

                    LISA (CONT'D)
          And I think he likes me.

                    GRU
          Hey Lisa, I was wondering if you--

Gru reaches out and taps her shoulder with his pointer
finger.

Then one of the other little girls points to Gru's finger on
Lisa's shoulder.

The other girls turn and squeal, horrified.

                      GIRLS

A little buck-toothed red-haired girl shouts out to the
entire playground.

                    RED HAIRED GIRL
          Lisa's got Grooties!

The playground erupts with SCREAMS and everyone turns and
runs away.

Little Gru is left alone.     Crushed.


INT: GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gru comes out of the flashback.

                    GRU
          Scared? Of what? Women?! No,
          that's bonkers! I just-- I have no
          interest in going on a date, that's
          all. Case closed. I'm not scared--
          of women... or dates... let's go to

Gru gives each girl a goodnight kiss.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Goodnight, Edith.

Then he goes over to Margo, who's already in bed.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Goodnight, Margo.

She continues texting as he gives her a kiss.

                    MARGO
          Does it matter?

                    GRU
          No, no, it doesn't matter... Unless
          it's a boy!

                    AGNES
          I know what makes you a boy.

Gru turns to Agnes, concerned.

                    GRU
          Uh...oooh...you...do?

                    AGNES
          Your bald head.

Gru nods, relieved.

                       GRU
          Oh, yes...

                    AGNES
          It's really smooth. Sometimes I
          stare at it and imagine a little
          chick popping out. Peep peep peep.

Gru sighs and gives her a kiss.

                    GRU
          Goodnight, Agnes.   Never get older.

Gru turns out the light and leaves the room.


INT: LAB - DAY

Gru rides the elevator tube down to his lab, passing minions
in various stages of jelly making. A sign reading, JELLY
TESTING AREA"" has been hastily pasted over a nuclear warning
sign.

A SUPERVISOR MINION checks his clipboard as the MINION next
to him steals a banana from his pocket. He turns, but the
Minion who stole the banana has hidden it in his mouth. We
see the ends of the banana pushing out his cheeks.

                      SUPERVISOR MINION
          Hey, oh!    Me banana!
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   20.


The Minion with the banana in his mouth shrugs.

A single apple is passed down a line of Minions in the least
efficient way possible.

A few Minions mash fruits in large vats ala ""I Love Lucy.""

One wears a bunch of fruit on his head like Carmen Miranda
and sings the CHIQUITA BANANA song. His supervisor comes
over and tells him to get back to work.

The Minion tries to get out of the vat of fruit, but slips
and falls down into a large test-tube filled with mashed
fruit.

Then all of the mashed fruit is flushed down a large hole
where it is injected into jelly jars passing by on a conveyor
belt. The trapped Minion is injected into one of the jars.

Gru enters the lab and greets the minions.

                    GRU
          Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

He points at Tim.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Donnie, hang in there, baby!    It's
          almost Friday.

Gru high-fives Donnie as he approaches Dr. Nefario.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          So, how's today's batch, Dr.
          Nefario?

                    DR.    NEFARIO
          I developed a    new formula which
          allowed me to    get every known kind
          of berry into    one flavor of jelly.

Gru sticks his finger in and tastes the purple goo in the
jar. Makes a disgusted face, then attempts a smile.

                     GRU
              (faking it)
          That tastes good...

          progress!
              (to the Minions)
          Here, try some of this.

He hands a jar to a minion, who tries it. He GAGS!   Another
minion tastes some and scrapes it off his tongue. They smash
the jar and all the minions run away, disgusted.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Whoa... okay, just because
          everybody hates it doesn't mean
          it's not good.

Dr. Nefario hangs his head.

          Listen, Gru. There's something
          I've been meaning to talk to you
          about for some time now.

                     GRU
          What?   What's wrong?

                    DR. NEFARIO

          An apple tree stands alone at the top of a hill. A handsome
          fox dressed in an Edwardian-style navy velvet suit leans
          against it with his arms folded and his legs crossed, chewing
          on a reed of wild grass. He holds an apple core in his paw.
          He spits out a seed. He looks off across a meadow that
          descends into the valley below.
          A female fox strides briskly up the hill. Her coat is a
          paler, especially beautiful shade of fox-red, and she wears
          men's trousers and a dark tunic. Fox says as she approaches:

                         FOX
          What'd the doctor say?

          MRS. FOX
          Nothing. Supposedly, it's just a twenty-

          I told you. You probably just ate some
          bad gristle.
          Fox brushes the fur on Mrs. Fox's ears with his paws. They
          walk together along the crest of the hill to a fork in the
          path. Fox points:

          Should we take the short cut or the

          Let's take the short cut.

          Great. It's actually slightly quicker,
          anyway.
          Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a
          quick circle around Mrs. Fox, wrapping his arm around her
          waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start off
          down the scenic route.

          A rustic cottage surrounded by a small barn, a tin silo, and
          a rickity windmill. There is a sheep in a little pasture. A
          sign on a rail says Berkus Squab. Fox and Mrs. Fox watch from
          the bushes outside a fence.

          MRS. FOX
          What is a squab?

                         FOX
          You know what a squab is. It's like a
          pigeon, I suppose. Anyway, it's a type of
          bird we can eat.
          Fox motions toward the edge of the property.

                         FOX
          Should we go through the hole under the
          horse fence or climb the rail over the
          bridle path?

          MRS. FOX
          Well, I guess the horse fence would be a
          little safer.

                         FOX
          But the bridle path puts us out right
          next to the squab shack.
          Mrs. Fox hesitates. She fiddles with her paws. She nods
          nervously. She shakes slightly. Fox looks at her funny.

                         FOX
          What's wrong? I've never seen you like
          this. You're acting all skittish. Don't
          worry. I've been stealing birds for a

          No, we'll do the horse fence. You gave me
          the scenic route already.
          Fox flashes a smile. He says suddenly:

                         FOX
          By the way, you look unbelievably
          beautiful tonight. You're practically
          glowing. Maybe it's the lighting.

          Mrs. Fox is, in fact, glowing, albeit ever so slightly. She
          stares at Fox enigmatically. Fox touches his paw to her
          cheek.
          (NOTE: an alternate version of Mrs. Fox will be used for this

          With the speed, grace, and precision of athletes, Fox and
          Mrs. Fox: dart through a hole under a painted fence; race
          along a thin trail next to a garage; crawl beneath a window
          where a blonde woman serves an early dinner, dealing
          hamburgers like playing cards to three little, blond
          children; creep past a doghouse where a golden retriever
          sleeps with an airline sleeping mask over his eyes; and
          shimmy over a doorway outside a workshop where a blond,
          bearded farmer hacks into a stump with a hatchet, completely
          pulverizing it into sawdust. They arrive in front of a wooden
          shed. Fox whistles sharply with a half-chirp and performs a
          rapid reverse-flip with a flourish.
          Fox lifts a loose board. He looks to Mrs. Fox and puts his
          finger to his lips for her to be quiet. She shrugs
          impatiently. They duck inside.
          They come back out. Each holds a dead, bloody pigeon in
          his/her teeth. They start to run away. Fox looks up above
          them. He stops. He frowns. He takes the pigeon out of his
          mouth and says curiously, pointing toward the sky:

                         FOX
          What's that? I think that's a fox-trap!
          Look at this.

          MRS. FOX
          Get away from there.

                         FOX
          Is it spring-loaded? Yeah...
          (pointing to different spots)
          I guess if you come from over there, and
          you're standing at the door to the squab
          shack, this little gadget probably
          triggers the --
          (gesturing to Mrs. Fox)
          Move out of the way, darling. That's
          right where it's going to land.
          Mrs. Fox runs back to Fox and tugs at his arm.

          MRS. FOX
          Come on! Stop it! Let's go!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.
          Fox pulls on a little, hanging wire. A chain unrolls rapidly
          from a pulley, and a steel cage falls slap down on top of
          them. A small tag on the base of it says Badoit et Fils. Fox
          and Mrs. Fox stand motionless, side by side, in disbelief.

                         FOX
          No, it just falls straight down right
          here, doesn't it? I guess it's not spring-
          loaded.
          Sounds come from around the farm: the dog barks, doors open,
          voices yell, lights come on. Mrs. Fox turns to Fox and says

                         QUIETLY:

          MRS. FOX
          I'm pregnant.
          Fox stares at Mrs. Fox. He is confused but moved.

                         FOX
          Wow. We're going to have a cub. Honey,
          that's great news!

          MRS. FOX
          If we're still alive tomorrow morning, I
          want you to find another line of work.
          Pause. Fox nods.

                         CUT TO:
          A wide shot of the entire valley. There are thick woods,
          green and yellow fields, two ponds, a small village, and a
          river running through the middle.

          2 YEARS LATER ( 12 Fox-Years)

          EXT. HOLE. DAY

          The entrance to a tunnel under a dirt mound covered with
          holly bushes.

          INT. HOLE. DAY

          A small, comfortable kitchen off a living room with two
          bedrooms behind it. Fox sits at the kitchen table reading a
          newspaper called the Gazette. His fur has gone grey at the
          temples, and he now wears a dark, double-breasted, pin-
          striped suit with a conservative necktie. Mrs. Fox stands at
          the counter-top stirring something in a bowl with a whisk.

          She is dressed in a paint-splattered, cream-colored,
          Victorian-style dress.

                         INSERT:
          A column in the newspaper with Fox's picture at the top of
          it. The caption reads: Fox about Town with Fantastic Mr. Fox.

                         FOX
          Does anybody actually read my column? Do
          your friends ever talk about it?

          MRS. FOX

                         (STILL STIRRING)
          Of course. In fact, Rabbit's ex-
          girlfriend just said to me last week, ""I
          should read Foxy's column,"" but they
          don't get the Gazette.
          (yelling into the next room)
          Ash! Let's get cracking!

                         FOX
          Why would they? It's a rag-sheet.

                         (SIGHS)
          I want to say I hate my job, but that
          would make it seem more important to me
          than I want people to think it is.
          Mrs. Fox puts down her bowl and starts slicing a loaf of
          bread. A small, narrow fox cub comes out of one of the
          bedrooms wearing white pants and no shirt. His hair is
          smashed all onto one side sticking up wrong. He is Ash.

                         ASH
          I'm sick.

          MRS. FOX
          You're not sick.

                         ASH
          I have a temperature.
          Mrs. Fox goes quickly over to Ash and puts her paw to his
          forehead.

          MRS. FOX
          You don't have a temperature.
          Ash turns away and says as he goes back into his bedroom:

                         ASH
          I don't want to go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

          MRS. FOX
          Hurry up. You're going to be late.
          Mrs. Fox goes back into the kitchen and starts making toast
          and coffee. Fox whispers to her:

                         FOX
          I love the way you handled that.
          Mrs. Fox looks at Fox sideways. She says loudly to Ash:

          MRS. FOX
          Your cousin Kristofferson's coming first
          thing tomorrow morning. I want you to be
          extra nice to him, because he's going
          through a very hard time right now, OK?
          Ash comes back out of his bedroom. He now wears a white
          cardigan and white socks with his white pants tucked into
          them. He says aggressively:

                         ASH
          Where's he going to sleep?

          MRS. FOX
          We're going to make a bed for him in your
          room tonight.

                         ASH
          I can't spare the space. Put him in Dad's
          study.
          Fox says without looking up from his newspaper:

                         FOX
          Dad's study is occupied by Dad.
          Ash goes back into his bedroom. Fox lowers his newspaper. He
          looks around the room. He says to Mrs. Fox:

                         FOX
          I don't want to live in a hole anymore.
          It makes me feel poor.
          Mrs. Fox stops buttering the toast. She looks to Fox and says

                         SOFTLY:

          MRS. FOX
          We are poor -- but we're happy.
          Fox twists his paw in the air, indicating:

                         FOX
          Comme-ci, comme-ga. Anyway, the views are
          better above ground.
          Mrs. Fox nods. She brings Fox a plate of toast and a cup of
          coffee. Fox takes her paw and says:

                         FOX
          I'm seven non-fox-years old now. My
          father died at seven and a half. I don't
          want to live in a hole anymore, and I'm
          going to do something about it.
          Fox kisses Mrs. Fox's paw. He suddenly eats three slices of
          toast in a second and a half, savagely but neatly. He stands
          and picks up his cup of coffee.

                         FOX
          Well, I'm off.
          Fox throws back the last of his coffee, kisses Mrs. Fox on
          the back of her neck, grabs his briefcase, tucks his
          newspaper under his arm, and walks to the door. He shouts

                         CHEERILY:

                         FOX
          Have a good day, my darlings!
          Ash comes out the bedroom again. He has now added a white
          cape to his ensemble and is in the middle of brushing his
          teeth. There is toothpaste all over his mouth. He waves
          briefly to Fox and goes back into his bedroom. Fox looks
          puzzled.

                         FOX
          What's he wearing?
          Mrs. Fox shrugs. She smiles sadly and waves to Fox. Fox waves
          back. He starts to go out but pauses to look down at a folded
          up section of his newspaper.

                         INSERT:
          A clipping from the real estate section. There is a
          photograph of a wide, sprawling beech tree at the top of a
          hill. A caption below it reads:
          Tree Living, Great Views, Classic Beech

          INT. TREE. DAY

          A door opens into a wide, low space with peeling paint. There
          is an old chair against the wall, a bare light bulb hanging

          from the ceiling, and a layer of dust over everything. A
          skinny weasel in a khaki outfit immediately starts in as Fox
          comes into the living room:

                         WEASEL
          Obviously, it's first growth, indigenous.
          Original dirt floor, good bark, skipping
          stone hearth --
          Weasel is interrupted by a loud banging clank. He and Fox
          peer into the next room. A heavy-set opossum with a cowlick
          tinkers with some pipes under the kitchen sink. He is Kylie.
          Weasel snaps at him:

                         WEASEL
          What'd I tell you? I'm showing the
          property. You're not supposed to be here.

                         KYLIE
          (checking his watch)
          Oh, cuss. What time is it? I'm sorry.
           Weasel sighs. He waves his arm in Kylie's direction and says
          distractedly, slightly annoyed:

                          WEASEL
           This is Kylie. He's the super.
           (aside to Fix)
          He's a little --
          Weasel makes a fluttering gesture with his paw. Fox nods. He
          points at a bucket on the floor next to Kylie among bolts,
          tools, and washers.

                         FOX
          What's in the bucket, Mr. Kylie?

                         KYLIE

                         (HESITATES)
          Just minnows. You want one?

                         FOX
          Certainly. Thank you.
          Kylie reaches into his bucket and hands Fox a live, wriggling
          minnow. Fox swallows it whole.
          Fox stares out the window at three sprawling poultry
          compounds in the distance. Black smoke pours out of a
          farmhouse chimney on each property. A sign on a water tower
          in the first compound reads Boggis Farms and has a picture of
          a chicken on it. A sign on a silo in the second compound
          reads Bunce Industries and has a picture of a goose on it. A
          sign on a windmill in the third compound reads Bean, inc.

          it.
          Weasel says pointedly from across the room:

                         WEASEL
          May I ask what you do for a living, Mr.
          Fox?
          Fox's eyes narrow as he looks out, entranced, with his mouth
          slightly open. He says almost inaudibly:

                         FOX
          I used to steal birds, but now I'm a
          newspaper man.

                         WEASEL

                         (PLEASED)
          Oh, sure. I've seen your by-line.
          Fox snaps out of his reverie and says suddenly:

                         FOX
          Good afternoon, gentlemen.
          Fox shakes hands abruptly with Weasel and starts across the
          room. Weasel is about to ask something when Fox stops in the
          doorway, looks back, and says:

                         FOX
          Oh, and Kylie -- thank you for the
          minnow. It was superb.
          Kylie smiles. Fox exits.

          A beaver dam across a bend in a fast stream. A still pond

          the door reads Badger, Beaver, and Stoat, L.L.P, Attorneys at

          documents. Fox paces the floor with his hands clasped behind
          his back.

          This is Boggis, Bunce, and Bean! Three of
          the meanest, nastiest, ugliest farmers in
          the history of this valley!
          An uneasy otter secretary peers in at them from the outer
          office. Fox looks intrigued.

                         FOX
          Really? Tell me about them.
          Silence. Badger sighs. He loosens his tie and settles in.

                         BADGER
          All right...

          A fat man with a huge moustache. He wears a tweed suit which
          stretches at the buttons so much that they look like they are
          about to snap off. He holds a carbine rifle. He stands in
          front of his farm, which contains row upon row of chicken
          houses. He has an ugly face. He is Boggis.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          Walter Boggis is a chicken farmer.
          Probably the most successful in the
          world.

          INT. BOGGIS' KITCHEN. DAY

          Boggis sits at a chopping block tearing into a boiled chicken
          with a fork and a meat cleaver.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He's unbelievably fat -- which maybe is
          genetic -- but he also eats three boiled
          chickens smothered with dumplings every
          day for breakfast, lunch, supper, and
          dessert. That's twelve in total, per

          Boggis' ear. Furry black and white hairs grow out of it. A
          fly buzzes around, lands on it, and crawls inside. Boggis
          sticks his pinky in after it and scratches.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He never takes a bath, as a result of
          which his ear holes are clogged with all
          kinds of muck and wax and bits of chewing
          gum and dead flies and so on.

          wears overalls and a cap. He holds a twelve-gauge shotgun. He
          stands in front of his farm, which consists of several long
          buildings in rows like a factory. He has a nasty face. He is
          Bunce.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          Nathan Bunce is a duck and goosefarmer.
          He owns about 2 million ducksand 500,000

          Bunce stands up to his nose in water. The depth reads 4FT.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He's so short his chin would probably be

          swimming pool on the planet.

          Bunce sits on two stacked telephone books on a chair. He guts
          a dead goose, cutting out its liver and mashing it with a
          fork. A plate of doughnuts cools on the table.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He eats only doughnuts with smashed-up
          goose livers injected into them.

                         CUT TO:
          A tall, skinny man in a long trench-coat. He holds a Luger
          pistol. He stands in front of his farm, which is an apple
          orchard that stretches over thousands of acres. He has a mean
          face. He is Bean.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          Franklin Bean is a turkey and apple
          farmer. He keeps his birds in an orchard

          where they run around squawking and
          gobbling, surrounded by apples.
          Bean aims his Luger and shoots a humming bird. Crazy turkeys
          run about among the trees.

          INT. BEAN'S SHED. DAY

          Bean works at a moonshine-type cider still, boiling chemicals
          and sipping from a bottle.

          BADGER (V.0.)
          He's probably anorexic, because he never
          eats anything. He's on a liquid diet of
          strong, alcoholic cider, which he makes
          from his apples. He's as skinny as a
          pencil, as smart as a whip -- and easily
          the biggest cusshole I've ever met in my
          life.

                         CUT TO:
          Fox and Badger in Badger's office.

                         BADGER
          In summation, I think you just got to not
          do it, man. That's all.

                         FOX
          I understand what you're saying, and your
          comments are valuable, but I'm going to
          ignore your advice.
          Badger leaps out of his chair and slams the office door. He
          points his finger at Fox and screams:

                         BADGER
          The cuss you are!

                         FOX

                         (IN DISBELIEF)
          The cuss am I?
          Fox jumps up and points back at Badger, screaming:

                         FOX
          Don't cussing point at me!

                         BADGER

                         (SCREAMING)
          Are you cussing with me?

                         FOX

                         (SCREAMING)
          Do I look like I'm cussing with you?
          Fox and Badger begin to snarl and snap savagely, knocking
          into the furniture as they circle around the room pointing in
          each other's faces. Suddenly, they calm down all at once,
          sighing deeply. Pause.

                         FOX
          One last thing: something's probably
          about to happen to me at work which I
          can't put my finger on but have a funny
          feeling about. How can I protect myself
          legally?

                         BADGER

                         (PAUSE)
          Are you about to get fired?

                         FOX

                         (SHRUGS)
          Slash quit.

                         CUT TO:
          A door with a frosted glass window. Letters painted on it
          read Gazette, Editor-in-Chief, Phillip Squirrel. Fox's
          silhouette stands across from that of a small squirrel
          sitting at a desk. The squirrel's silhouette says in a

                         GRAVELLY VOICE:

                         SQUIRREL
          You're fired.

                         FOX
          Slash I quit. Here's my letter of
          resignation.
          Fox's silhouette throws an envelope onto the squirrel's desk.

                         MONTAGE:
          Two muskrats in orange moving company uniforms unloads boxes
          and furniture from a wagon and carries them into the tree.
          Fox holds open the front door and barks orders at them.
          Two muskrats in white painter's uniforms paints the walls of
          the living room and the trim around the windows with rollers
          and brushes. Fox stands on the drop-cloth and barks orders at
          them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Two muskrats in blue electrician's uniforms work in the
          kitchen. Mrs. Fox watches over their shoulders and barks
          orders at them.
          Fox holds up a pair of flowered curtains in front of a
          window. He looks to Mrs. Fox. She stares at the curtains
          thoughtfully. She raises an eyebrow.
          Fox and Mrs. Fox sit in the windowsill looking out at the
          sunset. Ash stands in-between them. The flowered curtains
          wave in the breeze. Fox puffs on a pipe. Ash blows a soap
          bubble. Mrs. Fox puts out her paw and a butterfly lands on
          it. She smiles at Fox. He puts his arm around her. He raises
          a pair of binoculars to his eyes.

                         INSERT:
          A binocular shot of an industrial shack with Boggis Chicken
          House #1 stencilled on the front of it.
          Fox lowers the binoculars. His eyes sparkle.

          EXT. TREE. DAY

          Ash stands poised on a high branch over an inflatable
          swimming pool printed with a red-tartan plaid pattern. He
          wears over-sized swim trunks with a pattern of acorns printed
          on them. Fox sits in the grass eating an apple below with
          Mrs. Fox. She is painting at an easel. Ash yells:

                         ASH
          Watch this, Dad!
          Fox looks up. Ash leaps into the air and does a spectacularly
          awkward back-flip during which he appears to have four arms
          and three legs randomly attached to his body, flailing
          wildly. He hits the water by the side of his head and smacks
          into the surface back-first with a pained yelp. Fox grimaces.
          He claps mildly.
          (NOTE: an alternate version of Ash with four arms and three
          legs randomly attached to his body will be used for this
          stunt.)

                         FOX
          Good jump, Ash! Remember to keep your
          tail tucked!
          Fox looks at Mrs. Fox's canvas. It is a picture of the pond
          and landscape in severe weather with black clouds and
          lightning bolts. It is signed Felicity Fox. Fox raises an
          eyebrow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         FOX
          Still painting thunderstorms, I see.
          Fox sees a small, Samsonite suitcase on the ground next to a
          pair of yellow sneakers. He frowns.

                         FOX
          Whose suitcase is that?
          A boy's voice shouts from the high tree branch:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Hello, everyone! Good afternoon!
          Fox, Mrs. Fox, and Ash look up, surprised. A second Fox cub
          stands poised on the edge of the limb. He is taller, leaner,
          sleeker, and it is immediately apparent even by his posture
          infinitely more graceful than Ash. He is Kristofferson. He
          wears a professional Speedo with a patch on it that says Swim
          Team. Fox brightens.

                         FOX
          Kristofferson! Welcome to our little
          tree! I see you brought your swimming
          trunks!
          Kristofferson steps off the branch and performs a reserved
          but perfect jack-knife. He enters the water splashlessly. Fox
          leaps to his feet, applauding with his paws above his head,
          whistling and hollering:

                         FOX
          Look at that! This kid's a natural! I'm
          speechless, Kristofferson!
          Kristofferson smiles modestly and shrugs. Ash stares at him
          stonily. Fox turns to Mrs. Fox.

                         FOX
          Plus, he knows karate.

          INT. LIVING ROOM. EVENING

          Fox sits in his armchair reading the Gazette. Ash sits on a
          braided rug on the floor beside him reading a comic book
          called The Adventures of White Cape. On the cover, there is a
          picture of a ferret leaping off a motorcycle. Mrs. Fox is in
          the kitchen in the background flattening a hunk of dough with
          a rolling pin. Kristofferson is in the next room practicing
          tae-kwon-do. He wears khaki shorts, yellow sneakers, and a
          blue, short-sleeved, button-down shirt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         ASH
          Do you think I'm an athlete?

                         FOX
          (without looking up)
          What are you talking about?

                         ASH
          Well, you know, I think I'm an athlete,
          and sometimes I feel like you guys don't
          see me that way.

                         FOX
          What's the sub-text here?
          Ash thinks for a minute. He looks at Kristofferson in the
          next room. Kristofferson is now sitting Indian-style on the
          floor meditating. His paws are turned upward with his thumbs
          touching his index fingers forming a ring. Ash says loudly to
          Mrs. Fox in the kitchen:

                         ASH
          How long is Kristofferson supposed to
          stay with us?

          MRS. FOX
          Until your uncle gets better.

                         ASH
          Right, but roughly how long do we plan to
          give him on that? Double-pneumonia isn't
          even really that big of a deal, is it?
          In the background, Kristofferson stands up again and starts
          practicing violent karate kicks. Mrs. Fox leans into the
          doorway and whispers forcefully:

          MRS. FOX
          As a matter of fact, it is. He's lucky to
          be alive. Now --

                         ASH
          Right, but --
          Kristofferson yells suddenly as he does a spinning double-
          kick with a chop:

                         KRISTOFFERSON
          Ki-ya!
          Everyone looks startled. Kristofferson resumes his tae-kwon-
          do practice with an angry, wounded look on his face. Mrs. Fox

                         SAYS COLDLY:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

          MRS. FOX
          Lower your voice, Ash.

          EXT. TREE. NIGHT

          Fox and Kylie sit in a porch swing on one of the middle
          branches of Fox's tree. They drink cups of coffee. Crickets
          chirp.

                         FOX
          Kids are crazy, aren't they? You got to
          try it, though. Raising a family.

                         KYLIE
          Yeah. Sometimes I feel like maybe I

                         MIGHT --

                         FOX
          What do you think of this tree, by the
          way? It's great, huh?

                         KYLIE

          Yeah. No, I was just saying how some-

                         FOX
          I have one last part of what I was about
          to say.

                         KYLIE
          OK. Go ahead.

                         FOX
          I'm going broke. You want to help me
          steal some chickens?

          Fox's study, the next morning. A map of the valley with notes

CORAL
Mmm.

MARLIN
Wow.

CORAL
Mmm-hmm.

MARLIN
Wow.

CORAL
Yes, Marlin. No, I see it. It's beautiful.

MARLIN
So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think that we we're gonna
get the whole ocean, did you? Huh? [sighs] Oh yeah. A fish can breath out here. Did your
man deliver or did he deliver?


                                             1

CORAL
My man delivered.

MARLIN
And it wasn't so easy.

CORAL
Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.

MARLIN
You better believe they did--every single one of them.

CORAL
Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome.

MARLIN
So, you do like it, don't you?

CORAL
No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable
with the great schools and the amazing view and all, but do we really need so much space?

MARLIN
Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look,
look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by
their bedroom window.

CORAL
Shhh, you're gonna wake the kids.

MARLIN
Oh, right. Right.

CORAL
Aww, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.

MARLIN
You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then
this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done.

CORAL
I like Nemo.

MARLIN
Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

CORAL
Just think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents!

MARLIN
Yeah. What if they don't like me?

CORAL
Marlin.

MARLIN
No, really.

CORAL
There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one of them is bound to like you.

CORAL
What?

MARLIN
You remember how we met?

CORAL
Well, I try not to.

MARLIN
Well, I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'

Marlin!

CORAL
Get away!

Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go?

inside, you, right now.

MARLIN
No!

MARLIN
Coral? Oh!

MARLIN
Ohh. There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will
never let anything happen to you...Nemo.

First day of school! First day of school! Wake up, wake up! C'mon, first day of school!

MARLIN
I don't wanna go to school. Five more minutes.

NEMO
Not you, dad. Me!

MARLIN
Okay...huh?

NEMO
Get up, get up! It's time for school! It's time for school! It's time for school!
It's time for school! Oh boy! Oh boy!

All right, I'm up.

Oh boy--whoa!

Nemo!

First day of school!

[gasps] Nemo, don't move! Don't move! You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it.
All right, where's the break? You feel a break?

NEMO
No.

MARLIN
Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids?

NEMO
No.

MARLIN
Are you woozy?

NEMO
No.

How many stripes do I have?

NEMO
I'm fine.

MARLIN
Answer the stripe question!

NEMO
Three.

MARLIN
No! See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh,
you're okay. How's the lucky fin?

NEMO
Lucky.

MARLIN
Let's see.

MARLIN
Are you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

NEMO
Come on, dad. It's time for school.

MARLIN
Ah-ah-ah! Forgot to brush.

NEMO
Ohh...

MARLIN
Do you want this anemone to sting you?

NEMO
Yes.

MARLIN
Brush.

NEMO
Okay, I'm done.

MARLIN
You missed a spot.

NEMO
Where?

MARLIN
There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here!

======================================================================================

MARLIN
All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get
some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?

NEMO
It's not safe.

MARLIN
That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in.
And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes,
if you wanna do it four times--

NEMO
Dad..

MARLIN
All right. Come on, boy.

NEMO
Dad, maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark!

MARLIN

                                             4

I highly doubt that.

NEMO
Have you ever met a shark?

MARLIN
No, and I don't plan to.

NEMO
How old are sea turtles?

MARLIN
Sea turtles? I don't know.

NEMO
Sandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about
a hundred years old!

MARLIN
Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking
to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin,
hold my fin.

NEMO
Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?

MARLIN
Hey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go.

I'll pick you up after school.

CRAB KID
Come on, you guys. Stop it! Give it back!

MARLIN
Come on, we'll try over there.

MARLIN
Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?

BOB
Well, look who's out of the anemone.

MARLIN
Yes. Shocking, I know.

BOB
Marty, right?

MARLIN
Marlin.

BOB
Bob.

TED
Ted.

BILL
Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke.

BOB/TED
Yeah, yeah. Come on, give us a funny one.

MARLIN
Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any
other fish.

BILL
Aw, come on, clownie.

TED
Yeah, do something funny.

                                             5

BOB
Yeah!

MARLIN
All right, I   know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he
doesn't walk   up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place
and then the   sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.
None of them   were walking, so forget that I--

BOB
Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johansenn's yard, now!

KIDS
Whoa!

MR. JOHANSSEN
All right, you kids! Ooh! Uuh, where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where, where'd you go?

NEMO
Dad, dad...can I go play too? Can I?

MARLIN
I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.

MARLIN
That's where I would play

PEARL
What's wrong with his fin?

TAD
He looks funny!

SHELDON
Ow! Hey, what'd I do? What'd I do?

BOB
Be nice. It's his first time at school.

MARLIN
He was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin.

NEMO
Dad.

PEARL
See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles but you can't really
tell.Especially when I twirl them like this.

SHELDON
I'm H2O-intolerant. [sneezes]

TAD
I'm obnoxious.

MR. RAY
[singing] Oooh, let's name the zones, the zones, the zones. Let's name the zones of the
open sea.

KIDS
Mr. Ray!

SHELDON
Come on, Nemo.

MARLIN
Whoa, you better stay with me.

MR. RAY
[singing]..mesopolagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic. All the rest are too deep for you and
me to see.

MR. RAY
Huh, I wonder where my class has gone?

KIDS

                                               6

We're under here!

MR. RAY
Oh, there you are. Climb aboard, explorers. [singing] Oh, knowledge exploring is oh so
lyrical, when you think thoughts that are empirical.

NEMO
Dad, you can go now.

MR. RAY
Well, hello. Who is this?

NEMO
I'm Nemo.

MR. RAY
Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.

NEMO
Okay.

MR. RAY
You live in what kind of home?

NEMO
An anemo-none. A nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone--

MR. RAY
Okay, okay, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers!

MARLIN
Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him
take a break. Ten, fifteen minutes.

NEMO
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

MR. RAY
Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. Okay, class, optical orbits up front.
And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves...that means you, Jimmy.

JIMMY
Aw, man!

MR. RAY
[singing]

MARLIN
Bye, Nemo!

NEMO
Bye, dad!

MARLIN
Bye, son! Be safe.

BOB
Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer.

MARLIN
Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you?

BILL
Yeah, I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off.

MARLIN
They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you,
insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!?

BOB
Hey, Marty. Calm down.

MARLIN
Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy!

BOB
'Pony boy'?

                                             7

BILL
You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.

TED
Pity.

======================================================================================

MR. RAY
[singing] Oh, let's name the species, the species, the species. Let's name the species
that live in thesea.

NEMO
Whoa.

MR. RAY
[singing] There's porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three! Gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, and some fish like you and me. Come
on, sing with me. Oh...!

MR. RAY
Just the girls this time. [singing] Oh, seaweed is cool. Seaweed is fun. It makes it's food
with the rays of the sun...

MR. RAY
Okay, the drop off. All right, kids, feel free to explore but stay close. [gasps]
Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather. An entire ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck.
There are as many protein pairs contained in this...

TAD
Come on, let's go.

MR. RAY
Come on, sing with me! [singing] There's porifera, coelentera, hydrozoa, scyphozoa, anthozoa,
ctenophora, bryozoas, three!

NEMO
Hey guys, wait up! Whoa.

TAD
Cool.

TAD
Saved your life!

PEARL
Aw, you guys made me ink.

NEMO
What's that?

TAD
I know what that is. Oh, oh! Sandy Plankton saw one. He called, he said it was called a...a
butt.

NEMO
Whoa.

PEARL
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

SHELDON
Oh, look at me. I'm gonna go touch the butt. [sneezes] Whoa!

SHELDON
Oh yeah? Let's see you get closer.

PEARL
Okay. Beat that.

TAD
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

NEMO
Uh, my dad says it's not safe.


                                             8

MARLIN
Nemo, no!

NEMO
Dad?

MARLIN
You were about to swim into open water!

NEMO
No, I wasn't go out--but dad!

MARLIN
It was a good thing I was here. If I hadn't showed up, I don't know--

PEARL
Sir, he wasn't gonna go.

TAD
Yeah, he was too afraid.

NEMO
No, I wasn't.

MARLIN
This does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out
there.
You know you can't swim well.

NEMO
I can swim fine, dad, okay?

MARLIN
No, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school
in a year or two.

NEMO
No, dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean--

MARLIN
Clearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do
these
things but you just can't, Nemo!

NEMO
I hate you.

MR. RAY
There's--nothing to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a
scientist, sir. Is there any problem?

MARLIN
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little
too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.

MR. RAY
Well, I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.

MARLINLook, I'm sure he is. But you have a large class and he can get lost
from sight if you're not looking. I'm not saying you're not looking--

FISH KID
Oh my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea!

MARLIN
Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to get
you before another fish does! Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop! You take one
move, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me?
Don't touch the bo--Nemo!

TAD
[whispering] He touched the butt.

MARLIN
You paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man.
Do you hear me? Big...big--


                                             9

NEMO
Aaaah! Daddy! Help me!

MARLIN
I'm coming, Nemo!

KIDS
Aaaah!

MR. RAY
Get under me, kids!

NEMO
Ah! Oh no! Dad! Daddy!

MARLIN
Oh! Nemo! Unh! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Nemo! Nemo!

DIVER
Whoa! Hold on.

MARLIN
Oh no. No, no. It's gone, it's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No!
Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no!

MARLIN
Has anybody seen a boat!? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please!

DORY
Look out!

MARLIN
Waaaah!

MARLIN
Ooh, ooh...

DORY
Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry! I didn't see you. Sir, are you okay?

MARLIN
He's gone, he's gone..

DORY
There, there. It's all right.

MARLIN
He's gone.

DORY
It'll be okay.

MARLIN
No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat.

DORY
Hey, I've seen a boat.

MARLIN
You have?

DORY
It passed by not too long ago.

MARLIN
A white one?

DORY
Hi. I'm Dory.

MARLIN
Where!? Which way!?

DORY
Oh, oh, oh! It-it went, um, this way! And it went this way! Follow me!

MARLIN

                                             10

Thank you! Thank you, thank you so much!

DORY
No problem.

MARLIN
Hey! Wait!

DORY
Will you quit it?

MARLIN
What?

DORY
I'm trying to swim here. What, ocean ain't big enough for you?

MARLIN
Huh?

DORY
You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? You want a piece of me? Yeah,
oooh, I'm scared now. Whaat!?

MARLIN
Wait a minute..

DORY
Stop following me, okay!?

MARLIN
What? You're showing me which way the boat went!

DORY
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this
way. Follow me!

MARLIN
Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat
was going!

DORY
I did? Oh dear...

MARLIN
If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish!

DORY
No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.

MARLIN
Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this!

DORY
No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think
it does. Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you?

MARLIN
Something's wrong with you, really. You're wasting my time. I have to find my son. [gasps]

BRUCE
Hello.

DORY
Well, hi!

BRUCE
Name's Bruce. It's all right, I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of
bites like you doing out so late, eh?

MARLIN
Nothing. We're not doing anything. We're not even out.

BRUCE
Great! Then how'd you morsels like to come to a little get-together I'm havin'?

DORY

                                             11

You mean like a party?

BRUCE
Yeah, yeah, that's right--a party! What do you say?

DORY
Ooh, I love parties! Parties are fun!

MARLIN
Parties are fun, and it's tempting but--

BRUCE
Oh, come on, I insist.

MARLIN
O-okay..that's all that matters.

DORY
Hey, look--balloons! It is a party!

BRUCE
Ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

BRUCE
Anchor! Chum!

ANCHOR
There you are, Bruce, finally!

BRUCE
We got company.

ANCHOR
It's about time, mate.

CHUM
We've already gone through all the snacks and I'm still starvin'!

ANCHOR
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

CHUM
Come on, let's get this over with.

======================================================================================

BRUCE
Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge..

BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
'I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must
first change myself. Fish are friends, not food'.

ANCHOR
Except stinkin' dolphins.

CHUM
Dolphins! Yeah, they think they're sooo cute! 'Hey, look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin!
Let me flip for 'ya! Ain't I a somethin'!'

BRUCE
Right, then. Today's meeting is step 5, 'BRING A FISH FRIEND'. Now do you all have your
friends?

ANCHOR
Got mine.

DORY
Hey there!

BRUCE
How 'bout you, Chum?

CHUM
Oh, um, I seem to have misplaced my uh, friend.


                                             12

BRUCE
That's all right, Chum. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step, you can help yourself
to one of my friends.

CHUM
Oh, thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum, eh?

BRUCE
I'll start the testimonies. Hello, my name is Bruce.

ANCHOR/CHUM
Hello, Bruce.

BRUCE
It has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and
made into soup.

CHUM
You're an inspiration to all of us.

ANCHOR
Amen.

BRUCE
Right, then. Who's next?

DORY
Ooh! Pick me! Pick me!

BRUCE
Yes, the little Sheila down the front.

DORY
Woo-hoo!

BRUCE
Come on up here.

DORY
Hi. I'm Dory.

BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
Hello, Dory.

DORY
And, uh, well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.

CHUM
Hey, that's incredible.

BRUCE
Good on 'ya, mate!

DORY
Whew! I'm glad I got that off my chest.

BRUCE
All right, anyone else? Hello, how 'bout you, mate? What's your problem?

MARLIN
Me? I don't have a problem.

BRUCE
Oh. Okay..

BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
Denial.

BRUCE
Just start with your name.

MARLIN
Okay. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish--

CHUM
A clownfish? Really?!


                                             13

BRUCE
Go on, tell us a joke!

CHUM
Ooh! I love jokes!

MARLIN
Actually I do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea
cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the
sea mollusk says to the cucumber...

NEMO
Daddy!

MARLIN
Nemo!

CHUM
Nemo! Ha ha ha! Nemo! I don't get it.

BRUCE
For a clownfish, he's not that funny.

MARLIN
No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers.

DORY
Oh my, you poor fish.

CHUM
Humans. Think they own everything.

ANCHOR
Probably American.

BRUCE
Now there is a father looking for his little boy.

MARLIN
Ugh! What do these markings mean?

BRUCE
I never knew my father! [sobs]

CHUM
Aw, come here.

ANCHOR
Group hug.

CHUM
We're all mates here, mate.

MARLIN
I can't read human.

DORY
Well then we gotta find a fish who can read this. Hey, look. Sharks!

MARLIN
No, no, no, Dory!

DORY
Guys, guys!

MARLIN
No, Dory!

DORY
That's mine! Give it to me! Gimme! Oww!

MARLIN
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

DORY
Ow, ow, ow.


                                             14

MARLIN
I'm so sorry.

DORY
You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?

MARLIN
Ohh...

DORY
Ow, ow, ow.

BRUCE
Dory, are you oka--oohh. Oohh, that's good.

ANCHOR/CHUM
Intervention!

BRUCE
Just a bite!

ANCHOR
Hold it together, mate!

CHUM
Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!

BRUCE
FOOD!

MARLIN
Dory, look out!

BRUCE
I'm havin' fish tonight!

CHUM
Remember the steps, mate!

BRUCE
Just one bite!

BRUCE
G'day!

MARLIN/DORY
Aaaaaaaah!

BRUCE
Arrrr!

MARLIN
There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape!

DORY
Who is it?

MARLIN
Dory, help me find a way out!

DORY
Sorry, you'll have to come back later. We're trying to escape.

MARLIN
There's gotta be a way out!

DORY
Look, here's something! 'ESSS-CA-PE'! I wonder what that means. It's funny, it's spelled
just like the word 'escape'.

MARLIN
Let's go!

BRUCE
Here's Brucey!

MARLIN

                                               15

Wait a minute..you can read?!

DORY
I can read? That's right, I can read!

MARLIN
Well, then here. Read this now!

ANCHOR
He really doesn't mean it, y'know! He never even knew his father!

CHUM
Don't fall off the wagon!

MARLIN
Oh no, it's blocked!

ANCHOR
No, Bruce. Focus!

CHUM
Sorry about--this, mate!

ANCHOR
He's really--a nice guy!

MARLIN
I need to get that mask!

DORY
You want that mask? Okay.

MARLIN
No, no, no, no, no, no!

MARLIN
Quick grab the mask!

ANCHOR
Oh no. Bruce?

BRUCE
What? [gasps] Swim away! Swim away!

DORY
Aw, is the party over?

PELICAN
Nice.

======================================================================================

NEMO
Dad? Daddy?

DENTIST
Barbara?

BARBARA
Uh-huh?

DENTIST
Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please? And I'm going to need a few cotton rolls.

BARBARA
Okay.

DENTIST
Hello, little fella!

NEMO
Aah!

DENTIST
Heh heh heh! Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life out on the reef and
I saved him. So, has that novocaine kicked in yet?


                                             16

PATIENT
I think so. We're ready to roll.

BUBBLES
Bubbles! [muttering] My bubbles.

PEACH
He likes bubbles.

NEMO
Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!

JACQUES
Bonjour.

NEMO
Aah!

BLOAT
Heh heh! Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about.

DEB
Oh, he's scared to death.

NEMO
I wanna go home. Do you know where my dad is?

PEACH
Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.

NEMO
Pet store?

BLOAT
Yeah, you know, like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

GURGLE
Pet Palace.

BUBBLES
Fish-O-Rama.

DEB
Mail order.

PEACH
Ebay.

GURGLE
So which one is it?

NEMO
I'm from the ocean.

GURGLE
Ah, the ocean. The ocean! Aaah! He hasn't been decontaminated yet! Jacques!

JACQUES
Oui.

GURGLE
Clean him!

JACQUES
Oui.

GURGLE
Ocean!

JACQUES
Ooh, la mer. Bon. Voila. He is clean.

BUBBLES
Wow. The big blue. What's it like?

NEMO
Big...and blue?

                                             17

BUBBLES
I knew it.

DEB
Kid, if there's anything you need, just ask your auntie Deb, that's me. Or if I'm not
around, you can always talk to my sister Flo. Hi,how are you? Don't listen to anything
my sister says, she's nuts! Ha ha ha ha!

PEACH
[muffled] We got a live one!

BLOAT
Can't hear you, Peach.

PEACH
I said we got a live one.

GURGLE
Yes!

BLOAT
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

DEB
What do we got?

PEACH
Root canal, and by the looks of those x-rays it's not gonna be pretty.

PATIENT
Owwwwwwwww!

BLOAT
Rubber dam and clamp installed?

PEACH
Yep.

GURGLE
What did he use to open?

PEACH
Gator-Glidden drill. He seems to be favoring that one lately.

DEB
I can't see, Flo.

PATIENT
You're getting a little too--aaaaah!!!

PEACH
Now he's doing the Schilder technique.

BLOAT
Oooh, he's using a Hedstrom file.

GURGLE
That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex.

BLOAT
It's got a teardrop cross-section. Clearly a Hedstrom.

GURGLE
No, no. K-Flex.

BLOAT
Hedstrom!

GURGLE
K-Flex!

BLOAT
Hedstro--! [inflates] There I go. A little help over here.

DEB
I'll go deflate him.

                                               18

DENTIST
All right, go ahead and rinse.

GURGLE
Ugh! The human mouth is a disgusting place.

PEACH
Hey, Nigel.

NIGEL
What did I miss? Am I late?

PEACH
Root canal and it's a doozy.

NIGEL
Root canal, eh? What did he use to open?

PEACH
Gator-Glidden drill.

NIGEL
He seems to be favoring that one. Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus...
hello.

NEMO
[gasps]

NIGEL
Who's this?

DEB
New guy. Ha ha ha!

GURGLE
The dentist took him off the reef.

NIGEL
An outie. From my neck of the woods, eh? Sorry if I ever took a snap at you. Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta eat. [gasps]

DENTIST
Hey! No, no,   no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go! Go on, shoo! Oh,
the picture   broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece. She's going to be eight next week.
Hey, little   fella. Say hello to your new mummy. She'll be here Friday to pick you up. You're
her present.   Shh, shh, shh! It's our little secret. Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up
I'm going to   see a man about a wallaby.

BLOAT
Oh, Darla.

NEMO
What? What's wrong with her?

GURGLE
She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

BUBBLES
Poor Chuckles.

DEB
He was her present last year.

BLOAT
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

PEACH
She's a fish killer.

NEMO
I can't go with that girl! I have to get back to my dad! Aaah! Daddy! Help me!

GURGLE
Oh, he's stuck!

GILL

                                               19

Nobody touch him! Nobody touch him.

NEMO
Can you help me?

GILL
No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out.

PEACH
Gill..

GILL
I just wanna see him do it, okay? Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.

NEMO
I can't. I have a bad fin.

GILL
Never stopped me.

GILL
Just think about what you need to do.

BLOAT
Come on.

GILL
Perfect.

BUBBLES
Yay!

GURGLE
You did it!

DEB
Good squirming! Ha ha ha!

PEACH
Wow. From the ocean. Just like you, Gill.

GILL
Yeah.

PEACH
I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about?

GILL
I'm thinking, tonight, we give the kid a proper reception.

BLOAT
So kid, you got a name or what?

NEMO
Nemo. I'm Nemo.

======================================================================================

MARLIN
Nemo. Nemo. [mutters]

DORY
Are you gonna eat that? Careful with that hammer...

MARLIN
Huh? No, no! What does it say? Dory!

DORY
Sea monkey has my money...

MARLIN
Wake up! Get up! Come on! Come on!

DORY
Yes, I'm a natural blue...

MARLIN

                                             20

Get up!

DORY
Look out! Sharks eat fish! Aaaaaah!

MARLIN/DORY
AAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!

DORY
Wow. Dusty.

MARLIN
[gasps] The mask! Where's the mask? No! No, not the mask! Get it! Get the mask!
Get the mask! Get it!

DORY
[singing] Hoo doot doo doot doot doo doot. Whoo-hoo! La la la la la la. Just keeps
going on, doesn't it? Echo! Echo! Hey, what are you doing?

MARLIN
It's gone. I've lost the mask.

DORY
Did you drop it?

MARLIN
You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son, now it's gone.

DORY
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do?

MARLIN
I don't wanna know what you gotta do when life gets you down.

DORY
[singing] Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do?
We swim, swim.

MARLIN
Dory, no singing.

DORY
[singing] Ho ho ho ho ho ho! I love to swim! When you want to swim..

MARLIN
See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song now it's in my head!

DORY
Sorry.

MARLIN
Dory, do you see anything?

DORY
Aaah! Something's got me!

MARLIN
That was me. I'm sorry.

DORY
[gasps] Who was that?

MARLIN
Who could it be? It's me!

DORY
Are..are you my conscience?

MARLIN
Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?

DORY
Hmm, can't complain.

MARLIN
Yeah? Good. Now, Dory. I want you to tell me..do you see anything?


                                             21

DORY
I see..I see a light.

MARLIN
A light.

DORY
Yeah. Over there. Hey, conscience. Am I dead?

MARLIN
No, I see it too. What is it?

DORY
It's so pretty.

MARLIN
I'm feeling...happy. Which is a big deal for me.

DORY
I want to touch it. Oh!

MARLIN
Hey, come back. Come on back here.

DORY
[singing] I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna swim with you.

MARLIN
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend...good feeling's gone.

MARLIN
I can't see! I don't know where I'm going!

DORY
Haah!

MARLIN
The mask!

DORY
What mask?

DORY
Okay, I can't see a thing.

MARLIN
Oh, gee!

DORY
Hey, look! A mask!

MARLIN
Read it!

DORY
I'm sorry, but if you could just bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light.
That's great, keep it right there.


MARLIN
Just read it!

DORY
Okay, okay. Mr. Bossy. Uh, 'P'. Okay, 'P'. 'Shh-eer...Sher--P. Sher--P. Shirley? P.--'. Oh!
The first line's 'P. Sherman'!

MARLIN
P. Sherman doesn't make any sense!

DORY
Okay, second line. '42'.

MARLIN
Don't eat me! Don't eat me! Aaaah!

DORY
Light, please. 'Walla--Walla--Walla-beee'...

                                               22

MARLIN
Waah! Waaah! Waaaah!

DORY
The second line's '42 Wallaby Way'!

MARLIN
That's great! Speed read! Take a guess! No pressure! No problem! There's a lot of pressure!
Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure!

DORY
'Sydney'. It's 'Sydney'!

MARLIN
Duck!

DORY
Aaah!

MARLIN
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I died, I'm dead.

MARLIN
Whoo-hoo! [singing] We did it, we did it! Oh yeah, yeah, yeah! No eating here tonight, whoo!

BOTH
[singing] Eating here tonight!

MARLIN
Dory.

DORY
[singing] No, no, no eating here tonight. You on a diet--

MARLIN
Dory! What did the mask say?

DORY
'P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney'. [gasps] I remember what it said! I usually forget
things, but I remembered it this time!

MARLIN
Whoa, whoa, wait! Where is that?

DORY
I don't know. But who cares? I remembered!

MARLIN/DORY
Aaah!

DORY
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again!

Brother Bloat, proceed.

BLOAT
Nemo! Newcomer of orange and white, you have been called forth to the summit of Mount
Wannahockaloogie to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

NEMO
Huh?

PEACH
We want you in our club, kid.

NEMO
Really?

BLOAT
If you are able to swim through..THE RING OF FIRE! [whispers to Jacques] Turn on the

From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait.

Welcome, brother Sharkbait!

Enough with the Sharkbait.

GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh..ba-ba-doo.

GILL
Okay, Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed?

BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
Agreed!

GILL
We can't send him off to his death. Darla's coming in 5 days, so what are we gonna do?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do: we're gonna get him outta here. We're gonna help
him escape.

NEMO
Escape? Really?

GILL
We're all gonna escape!

GURGLE
Gill, please, not another one of your escape plans.

Sorry, but they, they just, they never work.

Yeah. Why should this be any different?

GILL
'Cause we've got him.

NEMO
Me?

GILL
You see that filter?

NEMO
Yeah?

GILL
You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing. What we need you to do is take
a pebble inside and jam the gears. You do that and this tank's gonna get filthier and
filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank himself. And
when he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in the individual baggies, then we roll
ourselves down the counter, out of the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the
street and into the harbor! It's foolproof! Who's with me?

BLOAT
Aye!

Aye!

Aye!

Well, I mean not..yes, yeah. It's just that you know I-I just can't afford anymore delays

a whole group of fish. They're..'delay fish'.

DORY
You mean..[whimper]you mean you don't..like me? [sobs]

No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't wanna be with you. It's a
complicated emotion. Oh, don't cry. I like you.

                  AND BREAK THE FROZEN HEART.
                  Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

   A young Sami boy, KRISTOFF (8), and his reindeer calf, SVEN,
   share a carrot as they try to keep up with the men.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

   Young Kristoff struggles to get a block of ice out of the

                  BEAUTIFUL! POWERFUL! DANGEROUS! COLD!
                  ICE HAS A MAGIC CAN'T BE CONTROLLED.

   A sharp ice floe overtakes the workers, threateningly. They

   In the dark, Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single

   The workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it
   pulls away.

   Left behind, Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a
   dinky little sled then head off.

   We sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the

   EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- NIGHT

   A humble castle, built of wood, nestled in a deep fjord.


   INT. CASTLE, NURSERY -- NIGHT

   ELSA (8) sleeps in her bed. Her little sister ANNA (5) pops
   up beside her.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  Elsa. Psst. Elsa! Psst.

   Elsa doesn't stir. Anna sits on Elsa and bounces.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                      (grumbling)
                  Anna, go back to sleep.

   Anna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on Elsa.
                                                              3
FROZEN - J. Lee



                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (drama queen-ish)
                  I just can't. The sky's awake, so
                  I'm awake, so we have to play.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  ...Go play by yourself.

   Elsa shoves Anna off the bed.

   Anna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated. But then she gets
   an idea. She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsa's
   eyelids.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (mischievously)
                  Do you want to build a snowman?

   Elsa's eyes both pop open. She smiles.


   INT. CASTLE STAIRCASE -- NIGHT

   Anna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  Come on, come on, come on, come on.

   Elsa tries to shush her, but Anna's too excited.


   INT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT

   The girls sneak into the ballroom. Elsa shuts the door.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  Do the magic! Do the magic!

   Elsa laughs and waves her hands together. Snowflakes suddenly
   burst forth and dance between her palms, forming a snowball.
   Elsa throws the snowball high into the air. Snow bursts out
   and flurries around the room. Anna dances about, catching
   flakes in her palms and mouth.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  This is amazing!

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  Watch this!

   Elsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice
   suddenly coats the floor, forming a giant ice rink. Anna
   slides off, laughing.

   PLAY MONTAGE:

   -Anna and Elsa roll giant snowballs and build a snowman
   together. Elsa moves his stick arms around.

                            YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
                      (goofy voice)
                  Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

   Anna jumps up and hugs him.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  I love you, Olaf.

   -Anna and Olaf appear to be dancing. REVEAL: Elsa is actually
   propelling them across the ice floor with her magic.

   -The girls slide down snowbanks together!

   -Anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air.

                              YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Catch me!

   Elsa makes another peak to catch Anna.

                              YOUNG ELSA
                  Gotcha!

   Anna keeps jumping. Elsa keeps casting magic.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (jumping faster)
                  Again! Again!

                             YOUNG ELSA
                      (struggling to keep up)
                  Slow down!

   Elsa suddenly slips.

   Her magic accidentally STRIKES Anna in the head. Anna tumbles
   down a snowbank and lands, unconscious.

                              YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
                  ANNA!

   Elsa runs to Anna and takes her in her arms. A streak of
   Anna's hair, where struck, turns white.

                            YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
                  MAMA! PAPA!

   The room around them fills with frightening ice spikes.
                                                                     5

   The parents burst through the frozen door. GASP at the sight
   of the room.

                            KING
                  Elsa, what have you done? This is

                      (seeing Anna)
                  Anna!

   The King and Queen rush to Anna and take her in their arms.

                            ELSA
                  It was an accident. I'm sorry,
                  Anna.

   INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT

   The King sifts through a shelf to find an ancient book
   inscribed with Old Norse runes. He opens the book, scrambles
   to a page with an ancient map.


   EXT. ARENDELLE -- NIGHT

   Carrying the girls, the King and Queen ride their horses out
   of the kingdom. Snow streams from Elsa's hands, leaving a
   trail of ice behind them.


   EXT. FJORD MOUNTAIN FOREST -- NIGHT

   A sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark
   woods. All of a sudden, the King and Queen race by with the
   girls, leaving the wake of ice.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Ice?

   EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT

   Kristoff rides Sven as they follow the trail of ice.

                            YOUNG KRISTOFF
                  Faster, Sven!


   EXT. THE VALLEY OF THE LIVING ROCK -- NIGHT

   Kristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley. They
   hide behind a rock and peek out.

   Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa. The Queen holds
   the still unconscious Anna.

                            KING
                  Please, help. My daughter!

   Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward
   them. It looks as though they'll be crushed!

   But, luckily, the rocks stop at their feet. The rocks then
   unfold, revealing bright faces.

                               YOUNG KRISTOFF
                  Trolls...?

   The rock in front of Kristoff ""wakes up."" Meet BULDA.

                            BULDA
                  Shush. I'm trying to listen.

   She grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them
   close. Sven licks her face and she eyes them both.

                            BULDA (CONT'D)
                  Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.

   Back below, the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth.
   They call him GRAND PABBIE. He approaches arthritically, but
   determined. He nods respectfully to the king.

                            GRAND PABBIE
                  Your Majesty.
                      (referring to Elsa)
                  Born with the powers or cursed?

                            KING
                  Born. And they're getting stronger.

   Grand Pabbie motions for the Queen to bring Anna to him. She
   does. He examines her.

                            GRAND PABBIE
                      (about Anna)
                  You are lucky it wasn't her heart.
                  The heart is not so easily changed,
                  but the head can be persuaded.

                            KING
                  Do what you must.

                            GRAND PABBIE
                  I recommend we remove all magic,
                  even memories of magic to be
                  safe.... But don't worry, I'll
                  leave the fun.

   Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Anna's
   head. We see her memories floating right above her. Grand
   Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary
   memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their
   nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the
   girls in winter gear. He puts the ordinary memories back in
   her head.

                            GRAND PABBIE (CONT'D)
                  She will be okay.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  But she won't remember I have
                  powers?

                            KING
                  It's for the best.

                             PABBIE
                  Listen to me, Elsa, your power will
                  only grow.

   As he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a
   silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes.

                            PABBIE (CONT'D)
                  There is beauty in your magic....
                  But also great danger.

   The snowflakes turn to sharp spikes.

                           PABBIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                  You must learn to control it.

   In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human
   figures to panic and attack Elsa.

                            PABBIE (CONT'D)
                  Fear will be your enemy.
                                                                     8

   Elsa gasps and buries her face in the King's chest. The King
   wraps his arms around Elsa, protectively.

                            KING
                  No. We'll protect her. She can
                  learn to control it. I'm sure.

   Over the King's words we...

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

   -The Arendelle castle gates shutting.

                            KING (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                  Until then, we'll lock the gates.
                  We'll reduce the staff. We will
                  limit her contact with people and
                  keep her powers hidden from
                  everyone... including Anna.

   -The castle shutters close.

   -Anna sits on her bed as Elsa's furniture disappears.

   -Anna rushes to the hall to see Elsa shut the door to her new
   room. Anna watches, confused and sad.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


   INT. CASTLE WINDOW -- DAY

   We look out on a gentle snowfall. Little Anna skips up to the
   window. She lights up at the sight of the snow and rushes
   down the hall.


   INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR -- DAY

   Anna knocks on Elsa's door and SINGS.

                     ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman?""

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?
                  COME ON LET'S GO AND PLAY.

   Anna peeks under the door.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I NEVER SEE YOU ANYMORE.
                  COME OUT THE DOOR.
                  IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GONE AWAY.
                                                                 9

   -INT. ANNA'S ROOM -- Anna plays with two dolls, gives up, sad.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  WE USED TO BE BEST BUDDIES
                  AND NOW WE'RE NOT.
                  I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME WHY.

   -ELSA'S DOOR. Anna peeks through the key hole.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

   -Anna calls through the keyhole.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SNOWMAN.

                            YOUNG ELSA (O.S.)
                  Go away, Anna.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (hearbroken)
                  ...OKAY BYE.

   -BEHIND THE DOOR -- DAY. Elsa sits at the window looking out,
   longingly. Suddenly, her icy hands freeze the windowsill.

   -LATER. The King slips leather gloves onto Elsa's hands.

                            KING
                  The gloves will help.

   He pats her gloved hand.

                            KING (CONT'D)
                  See? You're good....
                      (starting their mantra)
                  Conceal it.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  Don't feel it.

                            YOUNG ELSA & KING
                  Don't let it show.

   -INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR -- DAY. Anna, now 9, knocks on
   Elsa's door.

                            ANNA (9)
                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

   -INT. HALLWAY -- DAY. Alone, Anna rides a bicycle built for
   two in the hall by standing on the back seat.
                                                               10

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  OR RIDE OUR BIKE AROUND THE HALL?
                  I THINK SOME COMPANY IS OVERDUE...

   -INT. PORTRAIT ROOM -- DAY. Anna runs around the portrait
   room, gaining momentum to flip over the arm of the couch.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  I'VE STARTED TALKING TO
                  THE PICTURES ON THE WALLS.

   Anna lands PLOP on the cushions, then looks up at the
   painting above her of the courageous Joan of Arc.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  Hang in there, Joan.

   -INT. EMPTY LIBRARY -- DAY. Looks like no one's around.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  IT GETS A LITTLE LONELY
                  ALL THESE EMPTY ROOMS.

   But then we find Anna, laying at the base of the grandfather
   clock, playing with her braids, bored out of her mind.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  JUST WATCHING THE HOURS TICK BY.

   Anna's eyes follow the grandfather clock's pendulum.

                            ANNA (9) (CONT'D)
                  TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK.

   -INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- NIGHT. Elsa (now 12) paces as she panics.
   The entire wall is frozen behind her.

                            ELSA (12)
                  I'm scared. It's getting stronger.

                            KING
                  Getting upset only makes it worse.

   The King goes to hug her.

                            ELSA (12)
                  No. Don't touch me. I don't want to
                  hurt you.

   He and the Queen look at each other with alarmed sadness.

   -INT. LIBRARY -- DAY. Anna, now a teenager, slides past Elsa's
   room without stopping.
                                                                11

   -INT. KING AND QUEEN'S QUARTERS -- DAY. Anna runs into the
   room and throws herself into her parents' arms.

                            TEEN ANNA
                  See you in two weeks.

   -INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- DAY. Elsa curtsies in front of her
   parents, formally, not touching them.

                            TEEN ELSA
                  Do you have to go?

                            KING
                  You'll be fine, Elsa.

   -EXT. DOCKS -- DAY. The King and Queen leave on a ship.

   -EXT. ROUGH SEAS -- NIGHT. Lightning flashes. The sea rages in
   a storm. The King and Queen's ship is lost in the waves.

   -INT. CASTLE -- DAY. A portrait of the King and Queen is
   covered in mourning cloth.

   -EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY. Anna looks small, standing before her
   people, beside burial stones.

   -INT. HALLWAY, ELSA'S DOOR. Anna, still in her mourning
   clothes, approaches and knocks.

                            ANNA
                      (singing)
                  Elsa? PLEASE I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE
                  PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHERE YOU'VE BEEN
                  THEY SAY HAVE COURAGE
                  AND I'M TRYING TO
                  I'M RIGHT OUT HERE FOR YOU.
                  PLEASE LET ME IN.

   Anna slides down the door and sits with her head against it.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER.
                  IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.
                  WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
                      (weak, internal)
                  DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

   We move through the door...

   -INT. ELSA'S ROOM -- DAY. Elsa is sitting in the exact same
   pose as Anna. Her bedroom is frozen with ice. Snowflakes hang
   in the air, suspended by grief.

                                                        FADE OUT.

   EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- MORNING

   A new dawn rises over the fjords.

   Ships pull up to the docks. Guests pile out.

                            DOCK MASTER
                  Welcome to Arendelle!

   A BOY tries to get away as his MOTHER tries to stuff him in
   his bunad jacket.

                            BOY
                  Why do I have to wear this?

                            MOTHER
                  Because the Queen has come of age.
                  It's Coronation Day!

                            BOY
                  That's not my fault.

   They pass the May Pole being raised and a Sami ice harvester
   chatting with his reindeer. We recognize them as Kristoff and
   Sven, all grown up. Sven hops around excitedly like a dog and
   nuzzles Kristoff's chest.

                            KRISTOFF
                  What do you want, Sven?

   Kristoff leans in and speaks for Sven, as if he can.

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
                  Give me a snack.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  What's the magic word?

                            KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) (CONT'D)
                  Please!

   Kristoff pulls a carrot out of his shirt pocket and hands it
   to Sven. Sven tries to bite the whole thing.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Hey, hey, hey! Share!

   Sven takes a smaller bite. Kristoff then has a bite himself,
   not seeming to care that it's covered in reindeer slobber.

   We move on to PERSI and AGGIE, a super-excited couple who
   rush towards the castle.
                                                              13

                  I can't believe they're finally
                  opening up the gates!

                            AGGIE
                  And for a whole day! Faster, Persi!

   They pass a tiny but menacing DUKE, who wears taps on his
   shoes to ""enhance"" his presence. Two THUG guards follow close
   behind him.

                            DUKE
                  Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious
                  trade partner. Open those gates so
                  I may unlock your secrets and
                  exploit your riches.
                      (catching himself)
                  ...Did I just say that out loud?

   We leave him and head down the bridge towards the castle
   gates, passing an Irishman and a Spanish Dignitary.

                            IRISHMAN
                  Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to see
                  the Queen and the Princess. I bet
                  they're absolutely lovely.

                            SPANISH DIGNITARY
                  I bet they are beautiful.

   We move past them, to a particular castle window.

   Anna sits up. She's got major bedhead. She coughs. Snorts.
   Pulls a hair from her mouth.

   She falls back asleep while sitting. She snores. Her head
   drops, startling her awake.

                  Who is it?

                            ANNA
                  My sister's cor-neration...

   One eye opens enough to catch sight of her coronation dress.
   She bolts, wide awake in excitement.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Coronation Day! Ha ha!

                                                      SLAM CUT TO:


   EXT. CASTLE HALL -- DAY

   Anna bursts out of her room, wearing her coronation dress.
   She finishes pinning ribbons in her hair. Seeing the hustle
   and bustle of preparations, she can't help but SING.

                       ""For the First Time in Forever""

                  WHO KNEW WE OWNED 8000 SALAD PLATES...?

   -Anna slides along the floor of the ballroom in her socks.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)

   -Anna walks through the garden and follows a family of geese.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  DON'T KNOW IF I'M ELATED OR GASSY,
                  BUT I'M SOMEWHERE IN THAT ZONE
                  'CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
                  I WON'T BE ALONE.
                      (speaking)
                  I can't wait to meet everyone....
                  (GASP) What if I meet THE ONE?

   -Anna twists herself in a velvet drape like it's a gown. She
   acts like she looks gorgeous, but she looks ridiculous.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  TONIGHT, IMAGINE ME GOWN AND ALL-
                  FETCHINGLY DRAPED AGAINST THE WALL.
                  THE PICTURE OF SOPHISTICATED GRACE.

   -She notices the bust of a man across the room.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                      (google-eyed)
                  I SUDDENLY SEE HIM STANDING THERE,
                  A BEAUTIFUL STRANGER TALL AND FAIR.
                      (mouth full of chocolate)
                  I WANNA STUFF SOME CHOCOLATE IN MY
                  FACE!

   -She grabs the bust of the man and swings it around.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  BUT THEN WE LAUGH AND TALK ALL EVENING,
                  WHICH IS TOTALLY BIZARRE.
                  NOTHING LIKE THE LIFE I'VE LED SO FAR.

   The bust goes flying and lands on the top of the cake.

   -Anna bursts into the portrait room, bounces on the
   furniture, and interacts with the paintings.
                                                               16

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
                  THERE'LL BE MAGIC, THERE'LL BE FUN.
                  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
                  I COULD BE NOTICED BY SOMEONE.
                  AND I KNOW IT IS TOTALLY CRAZY
                  TO DREAM I'D FIND ROMANCE.
                  BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
                  AT LEAST I'VE GOT A CHANCE!

   -INT. LIBRARY. ELSA, now a very poised 21, watches out the
   window as the coronation guests arrive.

                            ELSA
                  DON'T LET THEM IN.
                  DON'T LET THEM SEE.
                  BE THE GOOD GIRL
                  YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE.

   Elsa moves to a painting of her father's coronation. She
   takes off her gloves and mimics the painting by holding a
   candlestick and ornament in place of an orb and scepter.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  CONCEAL. DON'T FEEL.
                  PUT ON A SHOW.
                  MAKE ONE WRONG MOVE
                  AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW.

   The candlestick and ornament ice over. Elsa gasps, slams them
   back down onto the table. She tries to reassure herself.

                            ELSA (CONT'D)
                  BUT IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY.

   We cut between Anna's excitement and Elsa's nerves.

                            ANNA
                  IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY!

                            ELSA
                  IT'S AGONY TO WAIT.

                            ANNA
                  IT'S AGONY TO WAIT!!!

                            ELSA
                  TELL THE GUARDS TO OPEN UP THE GATE.

                            ANNA
                  THE GATE!!!

   -Finally, the gates are open! Anna moves through the crowd,
   admiring the people around her.
                                                                  17

   -Anna hurries over the bridge and into the village square.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I KNOW IT ALL ENDS TOMORROW,
                  SO IT HAS TO BE TODAY!!

   -Anna SLAMS right into the breast of a HORSE!

   She falls back and lands in a small wooden boat. It tips off
   of the dock. She's heading overboard. But just then, the
   horse slams his hoof into the boat and steadies it.

                               ANNA (CONT'D)
                         (frustrated)
                  Hey!

                            HANS
                  I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

   The rider, HANS, sure is handsome and regal.

                            ANNA
                      (gentler)
                  Hey. I-ya, no. No. I'm okay.

                            HANS
                  Are you sure?

                            ANNA
                  Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I
                  was going. But I'm okay.

   He hops down from his horse and steps into the boat.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I'm great, actually.

                            HANS
                  Oh, thank goodness.

   He offers her a hand and their eyes meet. Chemistry. He helps
   her to her feet.

                            HANS (CONT'D)
                      (bowing)
                  Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

                      (curtseying)
                  Princess Anna of Arendelle.

                            HANS
                  Princess...? My Lady.

   He drops to his knees, head bowed. The horse bows too,
   curling his hoof up and out of the boat.

   The boat tips. Hans tumbles on top of Anna. Awkward.

                            ANNA
                  Hi...again.

   The horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it.
   Anna and Hans tumble the other way. Anna lands on top of him.

                            HANS
                  Oh boy.

                            ANNA
                  Ha. This is awkward. Not you're
                  awkward, but just because we're--
                  I'm awkward. You're gorgeous.
                      (did she just say that?)
                  Wait, what?

   Hans quickly gets to his feet and helps Anna up again.

                            HANS
                  I'd like to formally apologize for
                  hitting the Princess of Arendelle
                  with my horse...and for every
                  moment after.

                            ANNA
                  No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT
                  Princess. I mean, if you'd hit my
                  sister Elsa, that would be-- yeash!
                  `Cuz, you know...
                      (patting the horse)

                  But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.

                              HANS
                  Just you?

   Hans smiles, amused. She smiles back. The bells RING. She
   doesn't notice at first; she's too busy drinking in Hans's
   handsomeness.

             power of positive thinking

We are moving in again, towards the huddle, the voices of the
Great Male Gathering begin to cut through the wind blasts.

Louder and louder, until...

                       ELDER
             By the power of our Devotions...

                       ALL PENGUINS
             We turn the world once more.

                    ALL PENGUINS
          We bring back the sun.

The CHANTING crescendos, awe-inspiring, as it rises above the
sound of the gale, and, as if in response

THE EARTH TURNS!

The CURTAIN OF DARKNESS which overshadows Antarctica begins
to LIFT from the curvature of the southern hemisphere. The
vast ice-continent is BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED once more.

ON THE ICE SHELF

The ICE itself is moaning and groaning, like a living thing.

A SINGLE CRACK appears and widens, then forks and forks
again.

The whole expanse of fast-ice is DISINTEGRATING, starting at
the sea-ice and progressing towards the ice-cliffs.

Somewhere an ICEBERG breaks free from the face of a glacier
and smashes down into the frozen sea below. At the same
time...

THE EMPEROR COMMUNITY

An EGG cracks open, then another, then all in a rush, like
POPCORN.

Fathers are calling out to each other as their fluffy CHICKS
emerge to greet the daylight.

                          EXCITED FATHERS
          ...It's   a   boy!
          ...It's   a   girl!
          ...What   a   peach!
          ...What   a   bruiser!

Amongst the excited crowd of males and hatchlings we find
WISHFUL staring down at his egg still balanced on his feet.

                    FRIENDLY PENGUIN
          Late opener, huh? You thinks its alive?

                    WISHFUL
          I'll say. Listen...

He taps the egg with his beak. Bending close they hear a
TAPPING SOUND in REPLY.

                       FRIENDLY PENGUIN
             Well, how about that?

WISHFUL taps again. The tapping comes back louder. A TINY
FOOT pops out of the egg. Then ANOTHER. The Egg flips and
lurches off in a giddy DANCE.

                       WISHFUL
             Whoa li'l buddy, slow down!

THE FRIENDLY PENGUIN'S chick giggles at the DANCING EGG,
which finally trips and cracks, depositing baby MUMBLE.

                       MUMBLE
                 (hopping from one foot to the
                  other)
             Ow! Freezy, Fuh-Fuh-Freeezy! All Freezy!

                       OTHER PENGUINS
             ...Jees!
             ...You ever see a chick move like that
             before?
             ...is he damaged?
             ...is he deranged?

They gather round staring down at this strange little jigging
ball of fluff

                       WISHFUL
             What? Come on. He'll grow out of it.

Shovelling MUMBLE off the ice and into his BROOD POUCH.

                       WISHFUL (CONT'D)
             Come here, li'l Mumble. Let's get you
             warm and toasty.

Mumble SNUGGLES contentedly between his father's legs,
surveying his new world. The friend's chick, ELLA is staring
at him fascinated

                       ELLA
             Get him to do it again Daddy

                          FRIENDLY PENGUIN

          So What happens now, Dad?

          We Wait


THE ICE

A LONG LINE of male penguins, thousands of them, all with
their chicks, stand staring expectantly across the ice shelf.

At the front, we find WISHFUL and MUMBLE, who is jiggling
with anticipation, hopping from one foot to the other.

                    MUMBLE
          Is she coming soon?

                    WISHFUL
          Any day now.

                    MUMBLE
          Tell me again what she's like

                    WISHFUL
              (sings)
          a wiggle when she walks, a giggle when
          she talks, makes my world go round....

MUMBLE does a little SOFT SHOE SHUFFLE.

          Sorry. When I get happy my feet get happy
          too.

Caruso waddles past: A stern glance down at little Mumble as

                       WISHFUL
             `Cos it ain't penguin.

LATER

MIST rises off the ice shelf. The males are still waiting
with their chicks. Over this: The sound of Chicks crying.

MUMBLE between his father's feet, follows his father's
concentrated gaze.

                       MUMBLE
             Gee I'm hungry

                       WISHFUL
             Everyone's hungry son. The mommas are
             bringing fish soon.

Long pause

                       MUMBLE
             What's fish look like.

                       WISHFUL
             You'll see it when she brings one

STILL LATER

The baby penguins are HOWLING now.

Anxious fathers lean forward, peering into the distance.

Out of the thickening mist, a cluster of little BLACK DOTS
materialises.

                         PENGUIN LOOKOUTS
             ...Wives-ho! Wives-ho!
             ...Hubba-hubba! Wives-ho!
             ...Better late than never.

The distant females look exhausted as they totter unsteadily
across the ice towards their partners. The MALES break ranks
and rush towards the distressed females.

                         MALE PENGUINS
             ...Barbra-Ann!

Weaving anxiously through the throng, overhearing:

             You're not as fat as I thought you'd be.

                       FEMALE#1

THE GREAT COMMUTE

The ICE-SHELF is as busy as a freeway at peak hour with males
and females are hurrying BACK AND FORTH from the sea.

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             After that, with food being so scarce
             everyone was busy busy busy. Mom and dad
             were working so hard I didn't see much of
             them. Besides I had school to go to.

THE CRECHE

An efficient, caring TEACHER is giving a lesson to a class of
about thirty young chicks grouped in front of her.

                       TEACHER
             Settle class. Settle. We will begin with
             the most important lesson you will ever
             learn. Now does anyone know what that is?

MANY flippers go up.

                        TEACHER (CONT'D)
             Michael?

                       MICK

             Swimming? Catching Food?

                       TEACHER
             Anyone else?

Mumble looks astonished. What's more important than that

                       ELLA
             It's our Heartsong, Miss.

                       TEACHER
             Your Heartsong. Yes. The melody you hear
             inside, the thing that makes you
             different from every other penguin. So.
             Let's all be very still now and listen.
             And when you hear your song, let it come
             out. Who's first.

             You like it?

MRS ASTRAKHAN'S

             Through the whole body, from the beak
             right down to tippy-toes.

Her voice is seductive, hypnotic.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             And then slowly, very slowly...

She hears a strange TAPPING sound and looks down.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             Vhat? Vhat is this?

                            MUMBLE

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN
             And be spontanuous.

Once again his feet start twitching uncontrollably.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             No! Stop! No jiggy-jog!

                       MUMBLE
             I'm being spontanuous.

             Hokay. Enough. Stop. Hokay! Ve go back to
             the top. Forget the body, look inside the
             soul. No notes, no sonk, only feelink.

Mumble opens his beak, inspired.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             Yes, yes, lift up the head! That's it!

Mumble inhales, his eyes are shining, his body is shaking.

                    MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
          You take a big breath, good and...now! Now!

He's off again, DANCING LIKE A FOOL...wild, exuberant, totally
uninhibited and unselfconscious.

After some time, he remembers himself, stops and turns to the
Mrs Astrakhan who is BANGING HER HEAD against a lump of ice.

                    MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
          Disaster! Catastroff! I never fail!
          Never!

THE ICE SHELF

Follow Mumble as he wanders alone, back towards his class.

He stops some distance away, listening to the other kids who
are now performing with increasing virtuosity.

Ella is among them, her clear high voice borne to him on the
wind.

Mumble sighs and his little shoulders sink, no way he'll ever
be able to sing like that.

                    MUMBLE
          Its tough when you realise you'll never
          fit in. Plus I was beginning to moult

A piece of downy fluff is peeling off one wing

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          I couldn't face the class in this mood So
          I just kept going.

Music over: Walk on By as he wanders through the vast colony
head down against the wind, little feet padding over the ice,

Gradually the colony begins to thin.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Looking for what? I don't know? A
          different type of penguin?

The noise of the colony has faded behind him. He stops and
looks up.

THE EDGE


Before him, a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with
broken eggs and bits of feather. There are very few penguins
here and the ones he can see are all, frankly, weird.

A Penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to
himself. Another has his flippers wrapped tightly around
himself like a straightjacket. A troubled Penguin sings
angrily...""There's no business like show business.

CU on Mumble. As he looks back to the sanctuary of the colony
and then back out over the wasteland

                       MUMBLE
             Not the nicest place in the world but at
             least you could do what you liked here.

Fade in Music: (I'm Free by the Who) and Mumble is off,
skittering over the rubbish strewn ice, little feet dancing
to his hearts content until....

a shadow passes over him and

Whump! a huge SKUA BIRD, twice Mumbles size, with a cruel
flesh-eating beak, lands on the ice right on front of him.

                       SKUA
             Hey, whacha doin' dere flipperbird?

                       MUMBLE
             Me? Oh, nothing. What are you doing?

THREE MORE SKUAS descend. MUMBLE is surrounded.

                       SKUA#1
             Oh we just dropped in for a spota lunch.

Their dark eyes fix on Mumble. He is starting to feel uneasy
and backs away.

                       MUMBLE
             But ...but. I'm a penguin.

                        SKUA#1

The FIRST SKUA moves in on MUMBLE.

             And dis time I'm getting the juicy bits.

             I don't have juicy bits! Look...
             all bone and feather! Feel for yourself.

They fall over each other, fighting to take up Mumble's
invitation.

The Skuas stop momentarily.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Every seen anything like this?

He does a wild little TAPDANCE hoping to distract them.

             Nope.

          Ok boys, for once we gonna do dis
          civilised. Now...

The FIRST SKUA opens his beak to strike. Mumble has noticed a
YELLOW PLASTIC BAND around the Skua's leg.

                    MUMBLE
          Hey! What's that on your leg?

The FIRST SKUA halts his attack.

                    FIRST SKUA
          Interesting you should ask?

                    OTHER SKUAS
          No! No! Don't startim on that!

He turns and whacks the other SKUAS over the head with his
wing.

A WHEATFIELD

A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun.
As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.  Ahead
of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering
along a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, a
thin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.

The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle
of the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radar
devices on the roof that rotate constantly.

AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out
two large metal boxes.

THE VAN

AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal
boxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;


                                             CUT TO


INSIDE THE HOUSE

AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of
the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic
contraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools all
over the floor.

Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and
takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic
receptacles mounted in the sides.

He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,
clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.
Then he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball.
Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball
out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,
in the back.

As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  The
glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green
planet in space appears inside it.


                      AUSTIN
                    (looking at the holograph)

                 Hmmmm ....


He takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an
adjustment underneath the machine.  Suddenly a wire comes
loose from the sphere and begins to spark.


                      AUSTIN
                    (seeing sparks)

                 Uh - oh ....


As the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the
green planet begins to silently shake.

SPACE

With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips
out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving
thousands of glowing particles in its wake.

AUSTIN

Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly
repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other
adjustments.

A FOREST

From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,
dropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond
a far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoid
crashes in the distance.

The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful
girl approaches, picking mushrooms.


                                             CUT TO


A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET

An ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing
ball, and is drawn to it.  Picking the sphere up, she looks
at it.  Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,
unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.


                                             DISSOLVE TO

Night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful
girl passes through the glass gates and heads home.

THE GIRL'S BEDROOM

The girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to
her basket in the corner.  Through its side, the green ball
begins to glow brightly.

Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of
the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green
ball behind it.

The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to
surround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pans
up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond
the city gates, rising higher and higher.

THE OUTLANDS

Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera
heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,
where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of
a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.

The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant
mountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high
above the foothills, we begin to come down.

In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are
moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in
the mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.

At the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously
their leader - stops and points.

THE MOUNTAINS

A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains
toward the barbarians.

THE LINE OF BARBARIANS

The barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps
on going.  One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to
change, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.

As their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather
behind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous
looking sub-humans.

THE GATES OF KRAAN

A frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through
the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound
of ten thousand approaching footsteps.

The camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan.  In the glow
of sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black
war-horse, appears at the hillside and stops.  Then with a
thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians
comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.


                                             CUT TO


THE BARBARIAN LEADER

He is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-
eyed, he screams to signal the attack.  The bloodthirsty horde
charges down the hill behind him.

The camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the
gates of the city, destroying everything in their path.  Smoke
and flames are everywhere.  Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians
run from the onslaught.

As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN
LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shouting
a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive
doomed building in the middle of the city.


                                             CUT TO


THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS

At the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council
sits around a marble table.  From outside, we hear the battle
raging.

Pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council
members.


                      COUNCILMAN #3

                 They're killing everyone.  We
                 must escape!


                      COUNCILMAN #2

                 The city is burning!


                      COUNCILMAN #4
                    (throwing a parchment
                     before the Elder)

                 Even the mountains glow green and an
                 evil slime oozes down!


                      COUNCILMAN #1

                 Elder, we must arm ourselves!  We
                 must fight!


                      ELDER

                 Silence!


Everyone gets quiet.  Looking at the parchment thrown before
him, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.


                      ELDER

                 We are not a race of warriors.
                 We are statesmen, and scientists.
                 From our very beginning it was ordained
                 that the warrior-race of Taarak the
                 Defender would aid us in times of need.
                 This was the Pact!


                      COUNCILMAN #1

                 Taarak the Defender?  His race is
                 dead!  They cannot defend anyone!


                      COUNCILMAN #2

                 Some say that the race is not dead
                 - that one still lives.


                      COUNCILMAN #1

                 One?  What good is one?


                      ELDER

                 One of Taarak's blood can do much.


Outside, the sounds of battle grow louder.  A boy appears at
the doorway.


                      BOY

                 Elder!  They are at the walls!


                      COUNCILMAN #3

                 Well who is this last Defender?
                 How can he be summoned?


                      ELDER

                 It is Taarna, of the blood of
                 Taarak the Defender - the last of
                 the race.  And must be summoned as
                 my forefathers summoned Taarak
                 himself - from within!


                      COUNCILMAN #2

                 But will this Defender answer?


                      ELDER

                 A Taarakian has no choice.  They
                 must answer.  It is in their blood.


The clattering of armour becomes audible.


                      BOY

                 They are in the halls!  They are coming!!


                      ELDER
                    (calmly to the boy)

                 Bar the door.
                 (to the Councilmen)
                 We will summon the
                 Defender together.


The Councilmen nod.


                      ELDER
                    (shutting eyes)

                 Taarna ... Taarna ...


As the Councilmen take up the chant;


                                             CUT TO


THE DOOR

As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him
aside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is
the BARBARIAN LEADER.

With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow
and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed
troops rush in around him.

The chanting continues as we;


                                             CUT TO


THE OUTLANDS

We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only
decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure
breaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council's
distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.

Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings
and a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THE
DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of
a giant crimson bird.


                                             CUT TO


TAARNA'S FACE

She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing
behind her in the wind.

Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,
chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.

Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly
beast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into
the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged
rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.

Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As
she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion
on a chain around his neck.


                      HUMANOID

                 I owe you my life.  Let me
                 repay you ...


He takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.
Suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her
towards him.  His eyes change to a bright green as he forces
her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes.  As he
molests her, TAARNA is distracted.  She hears something - voices
inside her, chanting her name.

Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then she
powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's
ears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him
above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.

Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out
a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She then
lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,
next to the growling creature.

As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian
hungrily.


                                             CUT TO


AUSTIN GRIMALDI

He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.
As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching
deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange
diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connection
breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the
machine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke grows
thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.


                      AUSTIN

                 Dammit!


AUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair
of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.

The camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke
surrounds it and clouds over everything.  The buzzing sound
grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing
engines.  Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice
crackling over a radiophone.


                      BOMBARDIER
                    (V.O.)

                 Where the hell are we?


Suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers
come tearing out into the moonlit night.


                                             CUT TO


THE GROUND BELOW

The sound of jungle night creatures fills the air.  We see
palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.  The
scene is almost serene.  The camera pans and suddenly the
nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the
camera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on
the bomber's fuselage.  The pan stops at the tail of the
aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.

There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the
air.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of
sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence
... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters
the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.

Instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.
Silhouetted figures rush by.


                                             CUT TO


A GUN EMPLACEMENT

Japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun
skyward.  We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.


                                             CUT TO


CLOSEUP OF A SHELL

It is thrust into a breech.

THE B-17 FORMATION

As the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead
aircraft.  In the moonlight we see her name, ""Pacific Pearl"".


                                             CUT TO


INT. - THE ""PACIFIC PEARL""

                 We're there Stepek, right on
                 target ... Rabual dead ahead!


Suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti-aircraft
shells explode ahead of the aircraft, lighting the inside with
electric blue flashes.


                      BOMBARDIER

                 Gee!  Thanks for telling me,
                 Holden.  I thought it was Cleveland.

Ackack guns blast shells skyward.  The gun blasts light up
the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes.

He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes
light up his turret.

The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up
the fuselage interior.

THE TAILGUNNER

Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared
shitless.  He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at
the flak puffs behind the tail.

                 Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay

He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating.

THE PILOT'S COMPARTMENT

Suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the
pilot rears back with the blast.  The right windshield is
shattered.


                      PILOT

                 We took a hit ...


The co-pilot sags forward, held back only by his shoulder
straps.  His eyes stare.  Blood runs from under his helmet.
We know he is dead.


                      PILOT

                 Shit.  Elkhorn just bought it.


                      BELLYGUNNER

THE GROUND

We hear the shriek of descending bombs.  The explosions walk
across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we
see devastation.  The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an
enormous ball of fire.

Still silence, no reply from either name.

reports back.

This is the first time the kid's voice is not scared, just
puzzled.

quite as tight as before.  As the formation flies along,
puffs of cloud pass by, occasionally obscuring a machine.

LOW VIEW OF THE ""PACIFIC PEARL""

Under the ""Pacific Pearl's"" belly, we see the bellygunner
suspended in his small glass pod.  A red glow brightens up
as he drags on a cigar.  The rest of the formation are
visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud
waft past.  We begin to feel as if the weather might be
changing.

THE NOSE OF THE ""PACIFIC PEARL""

The BOMBARDIER is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle
and sings raucously.  From the front we look in on the pilot
with the dead co-pilot sagging in his seat next to him.

                 What happened?

                      PILOT

                 I dunno.  The shell exploded and he
                 collapsed.  I think he took it in
                 the head.

                 like my voice?


While all this banter has been going on the cloud has been
thickening.  Suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small

                 Something's wrong!

He is frantically tapping the compass.

                 You got a problem, Holden?


                      BOMBARDIER
                    (V.O.)

                 Naw, the kid's the one with the
                 problem.  He don't like my voice!


                      PILOT
                    (V.O.)

                 Button it up Stepek.  What's the
                 problem, Holden?


                      NAVIGATOR

                 I must have a malfunction, my compass
                 says we're heading north!

PILOT

He looks at his compass.

                    (V.O.)

                 Hey, can you guys see the rest of the

                      BELLYGUNNER
                    (V.O.)

                 Negative, there's too much cloud.


A sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of
the plane.


                                             CUT TO


THE COCKPIT

The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue,
lit by the lightning flash.  We pan past him to the compass in
the instrument panel.  It is spinning madly.


                      PILOT

                 What the hell ...


He reaches forward to tap the compass.


                      PILOT

                 Hey Holden, now my compass has gone
                 crazy.  It's spinning like a son of
                 a bitch!


                      NAVIGATOR
                    (V.O.)

                 Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic
                 field or something !!


                                             CUT TO


OUTSIDE THE PLANE

We see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the
on-board lights.  Suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine.


                      PILOT
                    (V.O.)

                 Christ, now they're all doing it!!


                                             CUT TO


THE INSTRUMENT PANEL

All the dials are going haywire.  Above the instrument panel
we see the windshield is spattered with rain.


                      BOMBARDIER
                    (V.O.)

                 You guys quit talking business?
                 I'm trying to sing here!  Oh I
                 put my finger in a woodpecker's ...

                    (irritably)

                 Can it Stepek, we got real problems.


Just then through the rain, a strange green glow is seen
in the distance.  It begins to curve toward the aircraft.


                                             CUT TO


OUTSIDE THE PLANE - NEAR BELLY TURRET

The turret swings as the gunner spots the glow.


                      BELLYGUNNER

                 Jesus!  Look at that!!


From under the starboard wing, we see the object approaching.


                      PILOT
                    (V.O.)

                 Look at what ... look at what!!?


                      BELLYGUNNER

                 It's out there, just look at it ...


                      PILOT
                    (V.O.)

                 For Christ sake, give us a position!


                      BELLYGUNNER

                 It's about four o'clock, just below
                 ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!


The glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits
the starboard inner engine.


                                             CUT TO


PILOT'S POV

He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the
broken starboard window ... the number three prop is bent
and windmilling wildly.  It has a strange green luminescence
about it ... the whole machine shakes.


                      PILOT

                 Damn.


The PILOT tries to fly the plane and do the co-pilot's job of
feathering the bad engine.  Suddenly it's too late as the prop
wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing.


                                             CUT TO


OUTSIDE THE PLANE

The prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircraft's
skin, near the TAILGUNNER'S position.

                 We lost the goddamned prop ...
                 Did it do any damage?  Kid, check
                 the tail.


Silence.


                      PILOT

                 Come in kid ... kid are you okay?


Silence.


                      PILOT

                 Travis; go check the back.


                      BELLYGUNNER
                    (V.O.)

                 Will do, skipper.

INSIDE HATCH

TRAVIS' turret opens and TRAVIS pulls himself up into the fuselage.


                                             CUT TO


THE PILOT

The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to
No. 2 engine.  The pressure drops.  The engine heat gauge
climbs rapidly.  A red warning light begins to flash.


                      PILOT
                    (to himself)

                 Goddamn it, now what?


He glances out of his window just in time to see a strange,
claw-like feeler coming out of the engine casing.  It detaches
one of the cooling gills, then another, and another.  They blow
away in the slipstream.


                      PILOT

                 Gremlins!
                 (rubbing his eyes)
                 Jesus, I must be getting tired.


                                             CUT TO


THE BELLYGUNNER

He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment.  All that is left
of him is a tattered skeleton.

TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face.  Quick as a flash,
from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his
throat.  The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split
second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame.


                      PILOT
                    (V.O.)

                 Travis, what's goin' on back there?


                                             CUT TO


TRAVIS

His eyes are open but he is obviously dead.  Through his helmet
headphone, we hear his name.

                 Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd,
                 I'd guess about two hundred miles.


All the time the engine pops and bangs wildly.


                      PILOT

                 For Christ's sake, find us a place I
                 can put her down!

He is fighting the controls.


                      PILOT

                 Shit!  I've gotta put her down!


                                             CUT TO

                    (V.O.)

                 For God sakes Stepek, shut up!


STEPEK takes another swig from his bottle.  He is lying on
his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft.
He is about to make another smart ass reply, when he hears a
strange scratching and chirping noise above his head.  He
looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear
through the lining above his head.  He blinks in disbelief and
throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey.


                      BOMBARDIER

                 Oh my God, there's ... there's ...
                 ahh ... keep away ... keep away ...
                 (struggles)
                 ... hey no ... hey somebody ...

                 you lay off the booze, you've got the
                 D.T.'s ...


STEPEK is wide-eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins
under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor.
He suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath
him, and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses.


                                             CUT TO


OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT

The lower half of STEPEK is hanging in the slipstream, kicking
madly.  We see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures.

STEPEK

He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately
clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.  Suddenly
an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone ... out
into the night.


                                             CUT TO


THE PLANE

Suddenly the No. 2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back
large gobs of orange flame.  The oil, heat and manifold gauges
are off the dial and red lights frantically flash.  Desperately
the PILOT looks out of the window.

Pieces begin flying off the engine.  The cowling disintegrates
revealing the bare engine beneath.  Small figures are frantically
busy ripping the engine to pieces.

          We skim above a dark, wild ocean. The camera turns toward a
          lone island, Berk. It is a gigantic shard of rock jutting
          straight out of the water.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          This, is Berk. It's twelve days
          North of hopeless, and a few
          degrees South of freezing to death.
          It's located solidly on the
          meridian of misery.
          The camera drifts over rolling hills to reveal a small
          village nestled on an outcropping of sea mounts.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          My village. In a word, sturdy.
          And it's been here for seven
          generations, but every single

          The camera drifts closer, circling.

          through the slats of wood, illuminating HICCUP, a gangly

          Dragons sweep back and forth, dodging axes and blasting the

          Hoist the torches!
          Massive flaming braziers are raised on poles, lighting up the
          night sky... and revealing swirling dragons of all types.
          Below, Hiccup crosses an open plaza and ducks into an open
          building with a tall chimney.

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - CONTINUOUS

          He crosses behind a counter, where a peg-legged, one-armed
          hulk of a Blacksmith reshapes blades with a hammer and tongs
          appendage.

                         GOBBER
          Ah! Nice of you to join the party.
          I thought you'd been carried off.
          Hiccup dons a leather apron and starts to put away Gobber's
          scattered appendages.

                         HICCUP
          Who me? Nah, come on! I'm way too
          muscular for their taste. They
          wouldn't know what to do with all
          this.
          Hiccup strikes a bodybuilder pose.

                         GOBBER
          They need toothpicks, don't they?
          Hiccup gets to work, transferring bent and chipped weapons to
          the forge as Vikings crowd the counter for replacements.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          The meathead with attitude and
          interchangeable hands is Gobber.
          I've been his apprentice ever since
          I was little. Well...littler.

                         STOICK
          We move to the lower defenses.
          We'll counter-attack with the
          catapults.

          Armed men rush past, flanking others who carry sheep to
          safety. Stoick follows up the rear as, overhead, a dragon
          strafes the rooftops with Napalm-like fire.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          See? Old village. Lots and lots
          of new houses.

                         VIKING

          FIRE!
          In response, the fire brigade charges through the plaza --
          four TEENS, tugging a large wooden cask on wheels. From it,
          they fill buckets of water to douse the flames. One among
          them is a cute, energetic Viking girl.
          Hiccup leans out of the stall to watch her.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Oh and that's Fishlegs, Snotlout.
          The twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut.
          And...

                         (DREAMY)
          Astrid.
          A SLOW-MOTION explosion erupts behind her, framing her in a
          sexy ball of fire. The others join her, looking awesome and
          heroic.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Their job is so much cooler.
          Hiccup tries to join them as they pass, but he's hooked by
          Gobber and hoisted back inside.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PLEADING)
          Ah, come on. Let me out, please. I
          need to make my mark.

                         GOBBER
          Oh, you've made plenty of marks.
          All in the wrong places.

                         HICCUP
          Please, two minutes. I'll kill a
          dragon. My life will get infinitely
          better. I might even get a date.

                         GOBBER
          You can't lift a hammer. You can't
          swing an axe...
          Gobber grabs a bola (iron balls connected by rope).

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          ... you can't even throw one of
          these.
          A Viking runs by and nabs it out of Gobber's hand, hurling it
          at a dive-bombing Gronkle. The bola binds its legs, sending
          it into a heavy crash.

                         HICCUP
          (ready with the answer)
          Okay fine, but...
          He rushes to the back corner of the stall and presents a
          bizarre, wheel barrow-like contraption.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... this will throw it for me.
          Hiccup OPENS the hinged lid of the device. An arm springs up,
          equipped with twin bows. They prematurely launch a bola,
          narrowly missing Gobber... and taking out a Viking at the
          counter.

                         VIKING
          Arggh!

                         GOBBER

          Hiccup. If you ever want to get out

          Gobber gestures in Hiccup's general direction.

          Gobber tosses him a sword.

                         GOBBER
          I'll take my chances. Sword.
          Sharpen. Now.
          Hiccup takes it begrudgingly and lobs it onto the grinding
          wheel. He stews... fantasizing...

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          One day I'll get out there. Because
          killing a dragon is everything
          around here.

          EXT. VILLAGE - LOWER PLAINS - CONTINUOUS

          Nadders land, gathering like seagulls around a seemingly
          vacant house.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          A Nadder head is sure to get me at
          least noticed.
          The Nadders clamber onto the building, tearing the roof and
          walls apart. Sheep pour out and SCATTER.
          Elsewhere, hippo-like Gronckles pick drying racks clean of
          fish and fly off like loaded pelicans.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Gronckles are tough. Taking down
          one of those would definitely get
          me a girlfriend.
          A stealthy, snake-like dragon head peeks over a rooftop,
          breathing gas into a chimney.

          A Zippelback? Exotic, exciting. Two
          heads, twice the status.
          A second head pokes through the door and lights it. KABLAM!
          The two heads fly through the explosion, their necks zipping
          together to reveal a single body.
          It flies past Stoick as he climbs to the top of a CATAPULT

          TOWER.

                         CATAPULT OPERATOR
          They found the sheep!

          Fire!
          Boulders are catapulted at the corralling Nadders...
          Just as a huge red dragon whips past, spraying the base of
          the catapult with sticky fire.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          And then there's the Monstrous
          Nightmare. Only the best Vikings go
          after those. They have this nasty
          habit of setting themselves on
          fire.
          It emerges from the flames, climbing the catapult with a
          leering, toothy grin.

                         STOICK
          Reload! I'll take care of this.
          Stoick takes on the Nightmare, face to hammer.
          Suddenly, a LOUD BALLISTIC MOANING streaks overhead. The
          catapult crew ducks.

          The Monstrous Nightmare suddenly stops fighting and takes
          flight. Stoick looks skyward.

                         STOICK

          JUMP!
          KABOOM! The Catapult EXPLODES as though hit by an artillery
          shell... sending Stoick and the crew leaping for their lives.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          This thing never steals food, never
          shows itself, and...
          The sound recedes, leaving the crippled catapult in flames.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...never misses.

          Gobber trades his hammer for an axe.

          Man the fort, Hiccup, they need me
          out there!
          Gobber pauses. Turns with a threatening glare.

          Stay. Put. There. You know what I

          WHAM! Hiccup pushes his wheeled contraption through a wall of
          clustered Vikings. He weaves through the ongoing mayhem, as
          fast as his legs can carry him.

          ON THE PLAIN BELOW
          The Nadders have cornered the house-full of sheep. They close
          in, ready to spring upon them.
          Stoick suddenly appears, HURLING FISHING NETS over them. The
          surprised Nadders are caught. Stoick and his men rush in.
          A Nadder blasts a hole through its net. Stoick leaps onto it,
          clamping his thick arms around its head, forcing its jaws
          shut.

                         STOICK
          Mind yourselves! The devils still
          have some juice in them.

          ON THE PLAIN ABOVE
          Hiccup reaches a cliff overlooking the smoking CATAPULT and
          drops the handles to the ground. He cranks several levers,
          unfolding and then cocking the bowed arms of his contraption.
          He drops a bola onto a chamber and then pivots the weapon on
          a gimbal head toward the dark sky.
          He listens, with his eye pressed to the scope, hand poised on
          the trigger. He hears the NIGHT FURY approaching... and turns
          his aim to the defense tower. It closes in for the final
          strike, completely camouflaged in the night.

                         HICCUP

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Come on. Give me something to shoot
          at, give me something to shoot at.
          KABLAM! The tower topples. The blast of fire illuminates the
          dragon for a split second. Hiccup pulls the trigger.
          KERTHUNK! The flexed arms SNAP forward, springing the weapon
          off the ground. The bola disappears into the sky, followed by
          a WHACK and a SCREECH.

          Oh I hit it! Yes, I hit it! Did
          anybody see that?
          Hiccup's victory is short-lived. A Monstrous Nightmare
          appears, slithering up over the lip of the cliff.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Except for you.
          ON STOICK, holding down the netted Nadders. He hears a
          familiar HOLLER and looks up to see...
          HICCUP running through the PLAZA, SCREAMING, with the
          NIGHTMARE fast on his heels.
          Alarmed, Stoick abandons the Nadders and runs off.

          DO NOT let them escape!

          IN THE PLAZA
          Vikings scatter as Hiccup dodges a near fatal blast. The
          Nightmare's sticky, Napalm-like fire splashes up onto
          buildings, setting them alight.
          Hiccup ducks behind the last standing brazier -- the only
          shelter available. The Nightmare blasts it, spraying fire all
          around him. Hiccup peers around the smoldering post. No sign
          of the Nightmare.
          He turns back to find it leering at him, blocking his escape.
          It takes a deep breath. Hiccup is finished.
          Suddenly, Stoick LEAPS between them, tackling the Nightmare
          to the ground. They tumble and wrestle, resuming their
          earlier fight. The Nightmare tries to toast him, but only
          coughs up smoke.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          You're all out.
          He smashes the Nightmare repeatedly in the face, driving it
          away. It takes to the air and disappears. Winded, Stoick
          turns to Hiccup.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Oh, and there's one more thing you
          need to know...

          The burnt brazier pole collapses, sending the massive iron
          basket crashing. It bounces down the hill, destroying as it
          goes and scattering the Vikings who were holding down the
          netted Nadders. The freed dragons escape... with several
          sheep in tow.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Sorry, dad.

          The escaped Nadders fly past with sheep in their clutches.
          The raid is over. The dragons have clearly won.
          The murmuring crowd eyes Stoick, awaiting his response.

                         (SHEEPISH)
          Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.
          Stoick grabs Hiccup by the back scruff of his collar and
          hauls him away, fuming with embarrassment.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          It's not like the last few times,
          Dad. I mean I really actually hit
          it. You guys were busy and I had a
          very clear shot. It went down, just
          off Raven Point. Let's get a search

                         STOICK

          He releases Hiccup. Everyone goes silent, staring

          disaster follows. Can you not see
          that I have bigger problems?
          Winter's almost here and I have an
          entire village to feed!
          Hiccup looks around. All eyes are upon him.

                         HICCUP
          Between you and me, the village
          could do with a little less
          feeding, don't ya think?
          A few rotund Vikings stir self-consciously.

                         STOICK
          This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

                         (EXASPERATED)
          Why can't you follow the simplest
          orders?

                         HICCUP
          I can't stop myself. I see a dragon
          and I have to just... kill it, you
          know? It's who I am, Dad.

                         STOICK
          You are many things, Hiccup. But a
          dragon killer is not one of them.
          Sting. Hiccup looks around to see many nods of agreement.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Get back to the house.

                         (TO GOBBER)
          Make sure he gets there. I have his
          mess to clean up.
          Stoick lumbers off in the opposite direction.
          Gobber leads Hiccup through the walk of shame. They pass the
          teen fire brigade as they snicker.

                         TUFFNUT
          Quite the performance.

                         SNOTLOUT
          I've never seen anyone mess up that
          badly. That helped!

                         HICCUP
          Thank you, thank you. I was
          trying, so...
          Hiccup avoids Astrid's glare and heads up toward a large
          house, standing prominently on the hill above the others.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I really did hit one.

                         GOBBER
          Sure, Hiccup.

                         HICCUP
          He never listens.

                         GOBBER
          Well, it runs in the family.

                         HICCUP
          And when he does, it's always with
          this... disappointed scowl. Like
          someone skimped on the meat in his
          sandwich.

                         (MIMICKING STOICK)
          Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid you
          brought me the wrong offspring. I
          ordered an extra large boy with
          beefy arms. Extra guts and glory on
          the side. This here. This is a
          talking fish bone.

                         GOBBER
          You're thinking about this all
          wrong. It's not so much what you
          look like. It's what's inside that
          he can't stand.
          Beat.

                         HICCUP
          Thank you, for summing that up.
          They reach the doorway.

                         GOBBER
          Look, the point is, stop trying so
          hard to be something you're not.
          Hiccup SIGHS heavily.

                         HICCUP
          I just want to be one of you guys.
          Gobber eyes him sympathetically. Hiccup turns and goes
          through the front door.
          And straight out the back door. He hurries off into the
          woods, determined.

          INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

          A noisy din of PROTESTING VOICES leads to...
          STOICK, glowering in the firelight. Surrounded by his men.

                         STOICK
          Either we finish them or they'll
          finish us! It's the only way we'll
          be rid of them! If we find the
          nest and destroy it, the dragons
          will leave. They'll find another
          home.

          He sinks his blade into a...
          LARGE NAUTICAL MAP, spread out on the table... the blade
          pierces the middle of an uncharted corner, swirling with
          painted sea monsters and dragons.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (DECIDEDLY)
          One more search. Before the ice
          sets in.

                         VIKING
          Those ships never come back.

                         STOICK

                         (MATTER-OF-FACT)
          We're Vikings. It's an occupational
          hazard. Now who's with me?
          Stoick throws up his fist. No one follows. The crowds shifts
          in restless silence. Head scratches. Eyes averted.

                         VIKING

          I've gotta do my axe returns.

                         STOICK
          Alright. Those who stay will look
          after Hiccup.
          Hands jut into the air, volunteers galore. Enthusiastic
          murmurs of prep and packing fill the room.

          PHLEGMA THE FIERCE
          To the ships!

                         SPITELOUT

                         (DRY)
          That's more like it.
          The Vikings rush for the door, leaving Gobber and Stoick
          alone. Gobber gulps back the contents of his tankard
          attachment and scrapes back the bench.

                         GOBBER
          I'll pack my undies.

                         STOICK
          No, I need you to stay and train
          some new recruits.

                         GOBBER
          Oh, perfect. And while I'm busy,
          Hiccup can cover the stall. Molten
          steel, razor sharp blades, lots of
          time to himself...what could
          possibly go wrong?
          Stoick sinks onto the bench beside Gobber, his brow burdened.

                         STOICK
          What am I going to do with him
          Gobber?

                         GOBBER
          Put him in training with the
          others.

                         STOICK
          No, I'm serious.

                         GOBBER
          So am I.
          Stoick turns to him, glaring.

                         STOICK
          He'd be killed before you let the
          first dragon out of its cage.

                         GOBBER
          Oh, you don't know that.

                         STOICK
          I do know that, actually.

                         GOBBER
          No, you don't.

                         STOICK
          No, actually I do.

                         GOBBER
          No you don't!

                         STOICK
          Listen! You know what he's like.
          From the time he could crawl he's
          been...different. He doesn't
          listen.

          goes hunting for... for trolls.

                         GOBBER

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          Trolls exist! They steal your

          Oh here we go.

                         STOICK
          My father told me to bang my head
          against a rock and I did it. I
          thought it was crazy, but I didn't
          question him. And you know what
          happened?

                         GOBBER
          You got a headache.

                         STOICK
          That rock split in two. It taught
          me what a Viking could do, Gobber.
          He could crush mountains, level
          forests, tame seas! Even as a boy,
          I knew what I was, what I had to
          become.

                         (BEAT)
          Hiccup is not that boy.

                         GOBBER
          You can't stop him, Stoick. You can
          only prepare him.

                         (BEAT)
          Look, I know it seems hopeless. But
          the truth is you won't always be
          around to protect him. He's going
          to get out there again. He's
          probably out there now.
          ON STOICK, as Gobber's words hit their mark.

          A drawn map of the island, covered in X's.
          Hiccup looks up from it and peeks over a gorge, expectantly.
          Sees nothing.
          He adds another 'X' to the page, then scratches his pencil
          over the whole map in frustration. He snaps the book closed
          and pockets it.

                         HICCUP
          Uggh, the gods hate me. Some people
          lose their knife or their mug. No,
          not me. I manage to lose an entire
          dragon.
          Hiccup WHACKS a low-hanging branch. It SNAPS back at him,
          hitting him in the face. He looks up to see a snapped tree
          trunk. His eyes follow it to a long trench of up-turned
          earth.
          He follows it to a downed, black dragon, its body and tail
          tangled in a bola. It appears dead. Hiccup approaches,
          beaming.

          He strikes a victory pose, planting his foot on the fallen

          I have brought down this mighty
          beast!
          It suddenly shifts.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Whoa!
          Hiccup springs back, terrified. He turns his blade on it.
          Rattled, Hiccup creeps along the length of the weak, wounded
          dragon, dagger poised to strike.
          As he reaches the head, Hiccup finds the Night Fury staring
          coldly at him. Hiccup tries to look away, but he's drawn back
          to its unnerving, unflinching stare.
          With the dragon safety tangled in the ropes, Hiccup jabs with
          his dagger, puffing himself up with false bravado.

           To the island village of Berk, festively adorned with flags
           and banners. Major new additions alter its familiar skyline.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           This... is Berk. The best kept
           secret this side of, well,
           anywhere. Granted, it may not look
           like much, but this wet heap of
           rock packs more than a few
           surprises.

          ON A CLUSTER OF SHEEP, hiding nervously between buildings as
          shadows of passing dragons race by. The group moves as one,
          receding into a shadowy alley, pushing one sheep out into the
          light. It's suddenly snatched and carried into the air!

                         

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Life here is amazing, just not for
           the faint of heart. See, where most
           folks enjoy hobbies like whittling
           or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer
           a little something we like to call--

          WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH! A wash of VIBRANT COLORS blurs by.
          DRAGONS BARREL PAST at a dizzying speed. Their RIDERS SWIPE,
          KICK, and ROLL into one another while they WEAVE neck in neck
          between the houses, docks, and revamped structures of Berk.

          Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff

          With a chivalrous grin, Snotlout tosses the sheep to Ruffnut.
          She SNATCHES it with a sneer and a GRUMBLE.

           Come on, Barf. It's starting to
           stink around here.
          Barf starts to peel off, spewing gas. Tuffnut mocks Snotlout
          with a mugging grin.

                          TUFFNUT
           Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow
           this place, Belch!
          Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and
          leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke.
          As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep
          into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap
          crossing. Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding
          dragon. The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep.
          Presiding over the game, STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd.

                          STOICK
           That's nine for the Twins, Astrid
           lags with three, Fishlegs and
           Snotlout trail with NONE!
          Stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end, its backboard
          painted with an image of Toothless.

                         

                          STOICK (CONT'D)
           And Hiccup is... nowhere to be
           found. Hmmm.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 3.

                         

                         

                          GOBBER
           Scared him off with the big talk,
           didn't ya, Stoick?
          WHACK! Snotlout, still smoldering from the blast, gets
          CLIPPED from behind. ASTRID, rolls in, astride STORMFLY --
          spirited and competitive as ever, and beautiful despite
          herself.

                          ASTRID
           What are you doing, Snotlout?!
           They're going to win now!

                          SNOTLOUT
           She's my princess! Whatever she
           wants, she gets.

                          ASTRID
           Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury
           you alive?!

                         

                          SNOTLOUT
           Only for a few hours!
          BACK TO THE RACERS, as they peel away, pouring on the speed.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Dragons used to be a bit of a
           problem here. But that was five
           years ago. Now they've all moved
           in. And, really, why wouldn't they?
          The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and
          into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon
          stables. They exit through the far side and circle back
          through the village, blasting past many of its dragon-
          friendly additions.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           We have custom stables... all-you-
           can-eat feeding stations... a full
           service dragon wash...

                         
          In the village, a baby Gronkle sneezes, accidentally setting
          one of the Viking houses aflame.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Even top-of-the-line fire
           prevention, if I do say so myself.
          Astrid rolls her eyes, peels away from the other dragon
          racers, and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of
          aqueducts, dousing the flames with a surge of water.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 4.

                         

                         
          BACK TO STOICK, amused as he watches the racers round the
          island, searching for sheep. He turns to Gobber and nods.

                         

                          STOICK
           It's time, Gobber.

                         

                          GOBBER
           Righty-ho!
           (aloud, to the crowd)
           Last lap!
          A HORN sounds. The racers all turn to each other, excited.

                          ASTRID
           The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly!
           We can still win this thing!

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Come on, Barf!

                         

                          TUFFNUT
           Let's go!

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           Go, Meatlug!
          GOBBER loads the BLACK SHEEP onto a catapult.

                         

                          GOBBER
           This is your big moment. Have a
           nice flight!

                         
          He pulls the trigger, LAUNCHING the black sheep into the air.
          Astrid spots it and steers Stormfly into a steep climb toward
          it.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Up, up, up!
          In a flash, Fishlegs and Meatlug blur past, NABBING the
          sheep.

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           No!

                          FISHLEGS
           Good job, Meatlug!
          Fishlegs tosses his captured prize to Ruffnut.

                          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)
           Here you go, darling. Mine's worth
           ten!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 5.

                         

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Yeah! The Black Sheep!
          Snotlout sighs, frustrated.

                          ASTRID
           You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?!

                          RUFFNUT
           I'm totally winning!

                         
          Fishlegs hovers up nest to Ruffnut with a starry-eyed smile.

                         

                          FISHLEGS
           We're winning together!
          She RAMS BARF into Meatlug, sending Fishlegs into an
          uncontrolled SPIN. He SLAMS into Snotlout, sending their
          dragons TUMBLING head over tail. The crowd goes wild.

                          RUFFNUT
           No one can stop me now!

                          TUFFNUT
           Except for me. We're attached,
           genius!

                         
          He GRABS at the sheep. Ruffnut fights back, inciting a tug-of-
          war.

                          TUFFNUT (CONT'D)
           Quit trying to steal all my glory!
          And while they're distracted, Astrid steers Stormfly toward
          them, CLOSING IN.

                         

                          STOICK
           Get `em, Astrid!

                         

                          TUFFNUT RUFFNUT
          It's MY glory! No sheep, no You're always ruining
          glory! EVERYTHING!
          Astrid leaps off of Stormfly, runs up Belch's spindly neck,
          and PLUCKS the black sheep from the Twins' hands.

                          ASTRID
           Gotcha!

                         
          She tumbles through the air onto Stormfly, sticking a perfect
          landing, black sheep in hand.

                         

                          RUFFNUT
           Astrid!
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 6.

                         

                         

                         
          BACK TO STOICK, beside himself. The crowd ROARS.

                         

                          STOICK
           Well played! Hahaha!
           (gloating, to the crowd)
           That's my future daughter-in-law!

          BACK TO ASTRID ON STORMFLY
          eyeing the fast-approaching FINISH LINE, unaware as...
          FISHLEGS suddenly RAMS Meatlug into Stormfly, sending Astrid
          off-course. She recovers and sees Snotlout flying headlong
          toward her, war hammer cocked, aiming at Astrid.

                          SNOTLOUT
           Uh, excuse me.

                          ASTRID
           Stormfly!
          Snotlout HURLS his hammer. Astrid ducks and rolls Stormfly
          out of the way. The hammer catches Fishlegs in the face with
          a CLANG. The crowd collectively winces.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly recover from their roll, loop over the
          water, and they BLAST past the finish line, DUNKING the black
          sheep into their basket!

                         

                          STOICK
           That's thirteen! Astrid takes the
           game!
          The crowd COMES UNHINGED. Astrid flies over the crowd,
          basking in her victory.

           HICCUP (V.O.)
           Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect.
           All of my hard work has paid off.
           And it's a good thing, too, because
           with Vikings on the backs of
           dragons, the world just got a whole
           lot bigger.

                         

          EXT. OPEN SKY/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY

          (Scene 0300 - AWOL Part One)
          A boundless sky. Vast. Clear. Crisp. And from it, a BLACK
          SPECK rockets across the horizon. The image of unbridled
          freedom.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 7.

                         

                         
          Tucked into his riding position, HICCUP appears to be part of
          TOOTHLESS. They dip, roll and dive, over a sea teeming with
          Thunderdrums, pulling off daring maneuvers with honed
          refinement, making them seem effortless.

                          HICCUP
           Yeah!
          They jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through
          the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying Timberjacks
          as they soar in formation.
          Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight
          suit -- an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and
          articulated plates. It has an air of Viking bike leather.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           What do you think, bud? Wanna give
           this another shot?

                         
          Toothless grumbles in protest.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Toothless! It'll be fine.
          With a click of a lever, he LOCKS the pedals in the flared
          tail position. Hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Ready?
          Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically.
          Suddenly, Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless, peeling away from
          him like a skydiver from a plane, YELLING as he plummets.

                         
          Toothless dives after him. They spiral through the air, face-
          to-face. Toothless is having fun, despite himself.
          Hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather
          flaps... and YANKS, unfurling SHEETS OF LEATHER as he extends
          his arms. They catch the wind, SNAPPING OPEN like WINGS...
          and sending him GLIDING -- out of control, at first, then
          stabilizing. The turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily.
          But he's flying!
          Toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with Hiccup.
          The freedom is palpable. Hiccup and Toothless are, for the
          moment, the same. Feeling the same rush of adrenaline.
          Independently together.
          They PLUNGE past cloud formations, splitting apart then
          crossing paths again.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 8.

                         

                         
          Impressive as it is, Hiccup is gliding at a steep angle.
          Toothless launches fireballs ahead of Hiccup, boosting him
          higher with the expanding heat bursts.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           This is amazing!
          A cloud layer washes past, exposing a towering ROCK
          FORMATION, dead ahead.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           No longer amazing! Toothless!
          Hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail.
          Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED, trying to catch Hiccup as he
          HURTLES toward collision. His locked tail makes maneuvering
          difficult. He's UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, no!
          At the last second, Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just
          ahead of Hiccup, then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly
          through it. The obliterated peak rains down around them.
          Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES
          into the trees of a neighboring peak. They tumble down the
          uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau.
          Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings. He
          switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and
          stows his leather wings.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           That really came out of nowhere.
          The blown up sea stack collapses.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           We gotta work on your solo gliding
           there, bud. That locked-up tail
           makes for some pretty sloppy rescue
           maneuvers, eh?
          Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet,
          revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete
          with a Viking braid.
          He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the NEW LAND
          stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea-
          stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the
          dappled afternoon sunlight.
           HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 9.

                         

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Looks like we found another one,
           bud.
          Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS, not amused, shaking off dust and
          pebbles like a wet dog.
          Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the
          head. He looks back to Toothless, who averts his eyes.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, what? Do you want an apology?
           Is that why you're pouting, big
           baby boo? Well... try this on!
          Hiccup TACKLES Toothless and tries to put him in a headlock.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up
           on all my heartfelt remorse?
          Toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting Hiccup off
          of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt a

                          ONE-LEGGED--

                         
          Hiccup looks down, seeing the precipitous drop below.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You're right! You're right! You
           win! You win!
          WHAM! Toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground.
          Hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. Toothless playfully
          retaliates with feline taps to Hiccup's head.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons
           and Vikings, enemies again, locked
           in combat to the bitter -- URFFF!
          Toothless rests his head on Hiccup -- SQUEEZING THE AIR out
          of him. Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup,
          lapping at his face and covering him in slobber.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Gaaaaagh!

                         
          Hiccup fights to get free, finally springing to his feet and
          shaking off the viscous saliva.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           You KNOW that doesn't wash out.

                         
          Toothless LAUGHS, pleased with himself.

                         
          Shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out
          before them, Hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and
          produces a leather-bound book.

                         
          He unfurls it to reveal an EXPLORERS MAP, modified with added
          strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-expanding
          world. Drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new
          dragons.
          Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his
          flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick.
          Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge,
          then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his
          forearm.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           So what should we name it?
          Toothless GURGLES as he gnaws under his wing, preoccupied.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           ""Itchy Armpit"" it is.
          Hiccup carefully draws the new island's outline.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might
           find a few Timberjacks in those
           woods? The odd Whispering Death or
           two in the rocks? Who knows...
           maybe we'll finally track down
           another Night Fury.

                          (BEAT)
           Wouldn't that be something?

                          (BURDENED)
           So, whaddya say? Just keep going?
          Toothless' ear plates suddenly SHOOT UP. He ROARS, and his
          call is answered by a familiar SCREECH. Hiccup turns to
          see...

          ASTRID rising into view, astride Stormfly. Stormfly grabs
          talon-fulls of rock to slow her landing.

           `Afternoon m'lady. Where have you
           been?

                         
          Astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as Toothless
          rushes up to greet them.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Winning races. What else? The real
           question is... where have YOU been?

                         

                          HICCUP
           Avoiding my dad.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Oh, no. What happened now?

                         
          Astrid sits beside Hiccup, inspecting his latest addition to
          the map. Behind them, Toothless greets Stormfly, inciting a
          play fight.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake
           up. The sun's shining. Terrible
           Terrors are singing on the rooftop.
           I saunter down to breakfast,
           thinking all is right with the
           world, and I get...

                         
          He gets to his feet and puffs out his chest.

           ... Son, we need to talk.

                         
          Astrid smiles and adopts Hiccup's sloppy slouch.

                          ASTRID

                          (APING HICCUP)
           Not now, Dad. I've got a whole day
           of goofing off to get started.

                         
          Hiccup breaks character, grimacing at her impression of him.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Okay, first of all, I don't sound
           like that. What is this character?
           And second... what is that thing
           you're doing with my shoulders?

                         
          Astrid laughs, jostling her shoulders in an awkward way.

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           A truly flattering impersonation.
           Anyway, he goes...
           (resuming Stoick's brogue)
           You're the pride of Berk, son, and
           I couldn't be prouder...

                         

                          ASTRID
           (continuing her impression

                          OF HICCUP)
           Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty
           impressed with myself, too.

                         

                          HICCUP
           WHEN have I ever done that with my
           hands?

                         

                          ASTRID
           You just did.

                         
          She laughs, playfully.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Okay... just...
           (holding her arms, mock-

                          STERN)
           Hold still. It's very serious.

                         
          She giggles, trying to hold a straight face.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           (resuming Stoick's brogue)
           You're all grown up, and since no
           chief could ask for a better
           successor, I've decided--

                         
          Astrid straightens, her face brightening.

                          ASTRID
           --TO MAKE YOU CHIEF! Oh, my gods!

                         
          She jumps to her feet, beaming...

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           Hiccup, that's amazing!

                         
          And socks Hiccup in congratulations, deliberately hitting the
          dorsal fin release button and triggering it to pop up. She
          laughs as Hiccup reels it back in, self-consciously.

          They're suddenly BOWLED OVER by Toothless and Stormfly.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Yeah, so... this is what I'm
           dealing with.

                         
          Astrid helps him up and dusts him off.

                         

                          ASTRID

                          (EXCITED)
           What did you tell him?

                         

                          HICCUP
           I didn't. By the time he turned
           around, I was gone.

                         
          Astrid picks up the map, folding it as she paces around him,
          processing it all.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Well, it's a lot of responsibility.
           The map will have to wait for sure,
           and I'll need to fly Toothless,
           since you'll be too busy...

                         
          She pauses, wincing in sympathy. She turns to Hiccup. He nods
          knowingly, taking the map from her.

                         

                          HICCUP
           It's not me, Astrid. All those
           speeches, and planning, and running
           the village... that's his thing.

                         

                          ASTRID
           I think you're missing the point. I
           mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be
           pretty excited.
          Hiccup shakes his head.

                         

                          HICCUP
           I'm not like you. You know exactly
           who you are. You always have.
           But...

                         
          He shuffles to the cliff's edge, gazing out at the new land.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           I'm still looking. I know that I'm
           not my father... and I never met my
           mother... so, what does that make
           me?

          He sits at the edge, looking burdened, restless. Astrid
          approaches and settles beside him, joining him in looking out
          at the distant horizon. She weaves another braid into his
          hair as she speaks.

                         

                          ASTRID
           What you're searching for... isn't
           out there, Hiccup.

                         
          She places a hand on his chest.

                         

                          ASTRID (CONT'D)
           It's in here.

                          (BEAT)
           Maybe you just don't see it yet.

                         
          She kisses his cheek, but gets a mouthful of Toothless'
          slobber. She grimaces, wiping it off.

                         
          Distracted, Hiccup eyes the horizon keenly.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Maybe. But, y'know... there is
           something out there.

                          (EXASPERATED)
           Hiccup...

                         
          He turns her face to the horizon. A distant smoke plume rises
          from a misty valley.

                         

                         

          EXT. LAPLAND WOODS/TRAPPER'S FORT - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          (Scene 0400 - Shot Down!)
          Hiccup and Toothless fly over the fjord, winding deep through
          undulating crimson and gold forests.

                         
          Astrid and Stormfly catch up as the autumn colors suddenly
          give way to charred timbers. They fly deeper, through ash and
          wafting smoke. Ahead, in a sheltered harbor, an explosion of
          ice stands as an eerie marker of what used to be a TRAPPER'S

          FORT.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Stay close.

                         
          They fly through the suspended remains of the buildings,
          splintered, and frozen in mid-destruction.

           What happened here?

          It's at once harrowing and puzzling. Toothless spots an
          enormous DRAGON FOOTPRINT in the muddy shoreline below,
          leaving him uneasy.

                         

                          HICCUP (CONT'D)
           Easy, bud.

                         
          As they crest the ice formations, Astrid spots a CREW OF MEN
          at the stern of a moored ship below.

                         

                          ASTRID
           Hiccup!

                         

           ERET (O.S.)
           Fire!

                         
          The men fire a stern-mounted cannon. The projectile unfurls
          into a NET. Hiccup and Toothless dart out of its way.

                         

                          HICCUP
           Astrid! Look out!

                         
          It HITS Stormfly, TANGLING her wings and causing her to spin
          uncontrolled. Astrid struggles to free her as they HURTLE
          toward a collision.

                         

                          ASTRID

           HICCUP!

                         
          Astrid falls off of Stormfly, but Toothless SNATCHES her at
          the last second.

                         
          Stormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net. Trappers rush
          out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons. She
          whips her tail, sending spikes flying.

                         

                          ERET
           Watch the tail!

                         
          A large, raven-haired trapper lunges over the spray of spikes
          and lands upon Stormfly's head, twisting it and taking her
          down like a rodeo cowboy.

                         

                          ERET (CONT'D)
           Tie those legs up!

                         
          Eret deftly ties her gnashing jaws shut, wrangling her into
          submission -- clearly a pro among pros. He looks up,
          revealing a handsome face and gleaming, intelligent eyes that
          search the sky as Toothless' tell-tale BANSHEE scream rings
          out.

          Toothless suddenly streaks across the sky, banking and
          landing with a FEROCIOUS ROAR.

                         

                          HICCUP

           What are you doing?

                         
          Astrid and Hiccup leap off of Toothless, rushing toward
          Stormfly.

                         
          Eret's men immediately draw weapons. Hiccup extends and
          ignites his DRAGON BLADE -- a telescoping fiery sword --
          impressive enough to wow Eret's men.

                         

                          ERET
           Back again?

                         
          Eret steps forward, focused only on Toothless.

Is this on?



INTERVIEWER

That's fine.



MR. INCREDIBLE

I can break through walls, I just can't...



INTERVIEWER

That's fine.



MR. INCREDIBLE

I can't get this on.



INTERVIEWER

So, Mr. Incredible...do you have a secret identity?



MR. INCREDIBLE

Every superhero has a secret identity. I don't know a
single one who doesn't. Who wants the pressure of being super all the time?



ELASTIGIRL

Of course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this
at the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, y'know
what I mean?



FROZONE

Superladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret
identity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something like that. I
said, ''Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego.'' or
anything like that. I mean, you tell me you're a
super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good.



MR. INCREDIBLE

No matter how many times you save the world, it always
manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved,
you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. ''I just cleaned up this
mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?''



INTERVIEWER

I could get to that point.



MR. INCREDIBLE

''Please?''



INTERVIEWER

Wait, no, don't get up. We're not finished.



MR. INCREDIBLE

Sometimes l think I'd just like the simple life, you know?
Relax a little and raise a family.



ELASTIGIRL

Settle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game!
I'm right up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the
world to the men? I don't think so. I don't think so.

POLICE RADIO

We interrupt for an important bulletin. A deadly high-speed
pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway, traveling northbound on
San Pablo Ave.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Yeah, I've got time.



OLD LADY

Mr. lncredible. Um, Mr. Incredible...



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

What is it, ma'am?



OLD LADY

My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.



[cat meows]



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Certainly, ma'am but I suggest you stand clear. There could
be trouble.



OLD LADY

No, no. He's quite tame.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Let go now!



[cat yowls]



POLICE OFFICER 1

Thank you, Mr. lncredible. You've done it again.



POLICE OFFICER 2

Yeah, you're the best.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

No, I'm just here to help.



POLICE RADIO

Attention all units. We have a tour bus robbery...



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Tour bus robbery. I've still got time. Officers. Ma'am.
Squeaker.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Cool! Ready for take-off!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

What the...? Who are you supposed to be?



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Well, I'm lncrediBoy.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

What? No. You're that kid from the fan club. [stammering]
Brophy. Brody. Buddy! Buddy!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

My name is lncrediBoy.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Look, I've been nice, I've stood for photos, signed every
scrap of paper you pushed at me but this is...



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

No, you don't have to worry about training me. I know all
your moves, your crime fighting style, favorite catch phrases, everything! I'm
your number one fan!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Hey! Hey, wait!

You know...you can tell a lot about a woman by the contents
of her purse, but maybe that's not what you had in mind.



THIEF

Hey, look--



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Elastigirl.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Mr. lncredible.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

No, it's all right. I've got him.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Sure, you've got him. I just took him out for you.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Sure, you took him out. His attention was on me.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

A fact I exploited to do my job.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

My job, you mean.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

A simple thank you will suffice.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Thanks, but I don't need any help.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Whatever happened to ''ladies first''?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Well, whatever happened to equal treatment?



THIEF

Hey, look, the lady got me first.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Well, we could share, you know.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I work alone.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Well, I think you need to be more...flexible.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Are you doing anything later?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

I have a previous engagement.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

[whistles]



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Now, you just stay here. They usually pick up the garbage
in an hour.

Hey, lncredible!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Hey, Frozone!



LUCIUS (FROZONE)

Shouldn't you be getting ready?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I still got time.



[crowd screaming]



WOMAN

He's gonna jump!



SANSWEET

I think you broke something.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

With counseling, I think you'll come to forgive me.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Wait a minute.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

[coughing] Bomb Voyage.



VOYAGE

[French] Mr. Incredible!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

And lncrediBoy!



VOYAGE

lncrediBoy?



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Hey, hey! Aren't you curious about how I get around so fast?
See? I have these rocket boots--



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Go home, Buddy.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

What?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Now.



VOYAGE

[French] Little oaf.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Can we talk? You always say be true to yourself, but you
never say which part of yourself to be true to. Well, I've finally figured out
who I am. I am your ward... lncrediBoy!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

And now, you have officially carried it too far, Buddy.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

This is because I don't have powers, isn't it? Well not
every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. I invented
these. I can fly. Can you fly?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.



VOYAGE

[French] And your outfit is totally ridiculous!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Just give me one chance! I'll show you. I'll go get the
police.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Buddy, don't!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

It'll only take a second, really.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

No, stop! There's a bomb!



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

Let go! You're wrecking my flight pattern! I can do this if
you let go!

BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

I can help you. You're making a mista---hey!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

The injured jumper. You sent paramedics?



POLICE OFFICER

They've already picked him up.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

The blast in that building was caused by Bomb Voyage who I
caught in the act robbing the vault. Now, we might be able to nab him if we set
up a perimeter.



POLICE OFFICER

You mean he got away?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Well, yeah. Skippy here made sure of that.



BUDDY (INCREDIBOY)

lncrediBoy!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

You're not affiliated with me! Holy smokes, I'm late.
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.



POLICE OFFICER

What about Bomb Voyage?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Any other night, I'd go after him myself, but I really
gotta go. But don't worry. We'll get him! Eventually!

LUCIUS (FROZONE)

You're very late.

How do I look? Good?



LUCIUS (FROZONE)

Oh, the mask! You still got the mask.



[cracks neck]



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Showtime.



PRIEST

Robert Parr, will you have this woman to be your lawful
wedded wife?



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

You're late. When you asked me if I was doing anything
later, I didn't realize you'd actually forgotten. I thought it was playful
banter.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

It was playful banter.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

Cutting it kinda close, don't you think?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

You need to be more... flexible.



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

I love you, but if we're gonna make this work, you've gotta
be more than Mr. lncredible. You know that. Don't you?



PRIEST

...so long as you both shall live?



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I do.



PRIEST

I pronounce this couple husband and wife.



[people cheering and whistling]



HELEN (ELASTIGIRL)

As long as we both shall live. No matter what happens.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Hey, come on. We're superheroes. What could happen?



ANNOUNCER

In a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for
saving someone who, apparently, didn't want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,
who was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed suit
against the famed superhero in Superior Court.



SANSWEET'S LAWYER

Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved. Mr. Sansweet didn't
want to be saved. And the injury received from Mr. Incredible ''actions'', so
quote, causes him daily pain.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Hey, I saved your life!



SANSWEET

You didn't save my life! You ruined my death, that's what
you did!



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Listen--



MR. INCREDIBLE'S LAWYER

My client has no further comment at this time.



ANNOUNCER

Five days later, another suit was filed by victims of the
el train accident. Incredible's court losses cost the government millions. And
opened the flood gates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over.



WOMAN

It is time for their secret identity to become their only
identity. Time for them to join us, or go away.



ANNOUNCER

Under tremendous public pressure, and the crushing
financial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits, the government quietly
initiated the superhero relocation program. The supers will be granted amnesty
from responsibility for past actions, in exchange for the promise to never
again resume hero work. Where are they now? They are living among us. Average
citizens, average heroes. Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world
a better place.

MRS. HOGENSON

Denied? You're denying my claim? I don't understand. I have
full coverage.



BOB

I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson, but our liability is spelled out
in paragraph 17. It states clearly...



MRS. HOGENSON

I can't pay for this.



BOB

[phone rings] Excuse me. [answers phone] Claims, Bob Parr.



HELEN

I'm calling to celebrate a momentous occasion. We're now
officially moved in.



BOB

Yeah, well, that's great, honey. In the last three years
don't count because...



HELEN

Because I finally unpacked the last box. Now, it's
official. Ha, ha, ha. Why do we have so much junk?



BOB

Listen, honey, I've got a client.



HELEN

Say no more. Go save the world one policy at a time, honey.
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids from school. See you tonight.



BOB

Bye, honey. Excuse me. Where were we?



MRS. HOGENSON

[sobbing] I'm on a fixed income, and if you can't help me,
I don't know what I'll do. [blows nose loudly] [sobbing]



BOB

All right, listen closely. I'd like to help you, but I
can't. I'd like to tell you to take a copy of your policy to Norma Wilcox
on...[whispering] Norma Wilcox. W-l-L-C-O-X. On the third floor. But I can't. I
also do not advise you to fill out and file a WS2475 form with our legal
department on the second floor. I wouldn't expect someone to get back to you
quickly to resolve the matter. I'd like to help, but there's nothing I can do.



MRS. HOGENSON

Oh, thank you, young man.



BOB

Shhh! [shouting] I'm sorry, ma'am! I know you're upset!
[whispering] Pretend to be upset.



MRS. HOGENSON

[sobbing]



MR. HUPH

Parr! You authorized payment on the Walker policy?!



BOB

Someone broke into their house, Mr. Huph. Their policy
clearly covers--



MR. HUPH

I don't wanna know about their coverage, Bob! Don't tell me
about their coverage. Tell me how you're keeping Insuricare in the black. Tell
me how that's possible, with you writing checks to every Harry Hardluck and
Sally Sobstory that gives you a phone call.

Morning break is over. Morning break is over.

PRINCIPAL

I appreciate you coming down here, Mrs. Parr.



HELEN

What's this about? Has Dash done something wrong?



BERNIE

He's a disruptive influence and he openly mocks me in front
of the class.



DASH

He says.



BERNIE

Look, I know it's you! He puts thumbtacks on my stool.



HELEN

You saw him do this?



BERNIE

Well...not really. No. Actually, not.



HELEN

Oh, then how do you know it was him?



BERNIE

I hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I've got him. See? You
see? You don't see it? He moves! Right there! Wait, wait! Right there! Right as
I'm sitting down! I don't know how he does it, but there's no tack before he
moves and after he moves, there's a tack. Coincidence? I think not!



PRINCIPAL

Bernie...



BERNIE

Don't ''Bernie'' me. [screaming] This little rat is guilty!



PRINCIPAL

You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the
trouble.



BERNIE

You're letting him go again? He's guilty! You can see it on
his smug little face. Guilty, I say, guilty!



HELEN

Dash, this is the third time this year you've been sent to
the office. We need to find a better outlet. A more...constructive outlet.



DASH

Maybe I could, if you'd let me go out for sports.



HELEN

Honey, you know why we can't do that.



DASH

I promise I'll slow up. I'll only be the best by a tiny
bit.



HELEN

Dashiell Robert Parr, you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff. The last thing you need is temptation.



DASH

You always say, ''Do your best.'' But you don't really mean
it. Why can't I do the best that I can do?



HELEN

Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to
fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else.



DASH

Dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of.
Our powers made us special.



HELEN

Everyone's special, Dash.



DASH

Which is another way of saying no one is.



BOY

Hey, Rydinger. Where you headed?



GIRL

Hi, Tony.



TONY

Hey.



BOY

Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?



TONY

That's kind of funny.

Hey, Tony, do you play football?



BOY 2

Tony, I thought we were gonna go swimming.

Do you have to read at the table?



BOB

Uh-huh. Yeah.



HELEN

Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes! Bob, could you help the
carnivore cut his meat?



DASH

Ow.



HELEN

Dash, you have something you wanna tell your father about
school?



DASH

[nervously] Well, we dissected a frog.



HELEN

Dash got sent to the office again.



BOB

[distracted] Good. Good.



HELEN

No, Bob, that's bad.



BOB

What?



HELEN

Dash got sent to the office again.



BOB

What?! What for?



DASH

Nothing.



HELEN

He put a tack on the teacher's chair...during class.



DASH

Nobody saw me. You could barely see it on the tape.



BOB

They caught you on tape and you still got away with it? Whoa!
You must have been booking. How fast did you think were you going?



HELEN

Bob! We are not encouraging this.



BOB

I'm not encouraging, I'm just asking how fast...



HELEN

Honey!



BOB

Great. First the car, now I gotta pay to fix the table...



HELEN

The car? What happened to the car?



BOB

Here. I'm getting a new plate.



HELEN

So, how about you, Vi? How was school?



VIOLET

Nothing to report.



HELEN

You've hardly touched your food.



VIOLET

I'm not hungry for meatloaf.



HELEN

Well, it is leftover night. We have steak, pasta. What are
you hungry for?



DASH

Tony Rydinger.



VIOLET

Shut up!



DASH

Well, you are.



VIOLET

I said, shut up, you little insect!



DASH

Well, she is.



HELEN

Do not shout at the table. Honey!



BOB

Kids! Listen to your mother.



DASH

She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf.



VIOLET

That's it!



HELEN

Stop it!



DASH

You're gonna be toast!



HELEN

Stop running in the house. Sit down!



DASH

Ow! Hey, no force fields!



VIOLET

You started it.



HELEN

You sit down! You sit down! Violet!



BOB

''Simon J. Paladino, longtime advocate of superhero rights,
is missing''? Gazerbeam.



HELEN

Bob! It's time to engage. Do something! Don't just stand
there! I need you to intervene!



BOB

You want me to intervene? Okay. I'm intervening. I'm
intervening!



HELEN

Violet, let go of your brother!



JACK-JACK

Hello?



BOB

Get the door.



DASH

Hey, Lucius!



LUCIUS

LUCIUS

Whoa!



LUCIUS

Ha, ha.



DASH

Oh! I like it when it shatters.



BOB

I'll be back later.



HELEN

Hey, where are you two going?



BOB

It's Wednesday.



HELEN

Oh. Bowling night. Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius.



LUCIUS

Will do. Good night, Helen. Good night, kids.



HELEN

Don't think you've avoided talking about your trip to the
principal's office, young man. Your father and I are still gonna discuss it.



DASH

I'm not the only kid who's been sent to the office, you
know.



HELEN

Other kids don't have superpowers. Now, it's perfectly
normal...



VIOLET

Normal? What do you know about normal? What does anyone in
this family know about normal?



HELEN

Now, wait a minute, young lady.



VIOLET

We act normal, mom. I wanna be normal! The only normal one
is Jack-Jack, and he's not even toilet trained.



[Jack-Jack laughing]



DASH

Lucky. I meant about being normal.

LUCIUS

So now I'm in deep trouble. I mean, one more jolt of this
death ray and I'm an epitaph. Somehow I managed to find cover and what does
Baron Von Ruthless do?



BOB

He starts monologuing.



LUCIUS

He starts monologuing! He starts like this prepared speech
about how feeble I am compared to him. How inevitable my defeat is, how the
world will soon be his! Yada, yada, yada.



BOB

Yammering.



LUCIUS

Yammering! I mean, the guy has me on a platter, and he
won't shut up.



POLICE RADIO

Municiberg, we have a 23-56...



BOB

23-56, what is that? Robbery?



LUCIUS

This is just sad.



BOB

Yeah, robbery. Want to catch a robber?



LUCIUS

No. Tell you the truth, I'd rather go bowling. Look, what
if we actually did what our wives think we're doing? Just to shake things up.



WOMAN

He's not alone. The fat guy's still with him. They're just
talking.



LUCIUS

What are we doing here, Bob?



BOB

Protecting people.



LUCIUS

Nobody asked us.



BOB

You need an invitation?



LUCIUS

I'd like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this,
and...you remember Gazerbeam?



BOB

Yeah. There was something about him in the paper.



LUCIUS

He had trouble adjusting to civilian life, too.



BOB

When's the last time you saw him?



LUCIUS

I don't see anyone from the old days, Bob. Just you. And
we're pushing our luck as it is.



BOB

Oh, come on.



LUCIUS

It was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this, we're
gonna get--



POLICE RADIO

We have a report on a fire...



BOB

A fire. We're close! [yelling] Yeah, baby!



LUCIUS

We're gonna get caught.



BOB

Woohoo! Haha!  Fire! Yeah!



LUCIUS

Is that everybody?



BOB

Yeah, that's everyone.



LUCIUS

It better be.



BOB

Can't you put this out?



LUCIUS

I can't lay down a layer thick enough! It's evaporating too
fast!



BOB

Well, what's that mean?



LUCIUS

It means it's hot! And I'm dehydrated, Bob!



BOB

You're out of ice? You can't run out of ice! I thought you
can use water in the air!



LUCIUS

There is no water in this air! What's your excuse, run out
of muscle?



BOB

I just can't go smashing into walls! The building's getting
weaker by the second! It's gonna come down on top of us!



LUCIUS

I wanted to go bowling!



BOB

All right! Stay right on my tail! This is gonna get hot!



BOB

Yeah.



BOB

[realizes they're in a jewelry store...] Uh-oh.



BOB

[...and unknowingly trips the alarm] Oh, good.

LUCIUS

Oh, now...that ain't right!



LUCIUS/BOB

I thought you'd be back by 11 .

I said I'd be back later.



HELEN

I assumed you'd be back later. lf you came back at
all...you'd be ''back later''.



BOB

Well, I'm back, okay?



HELEN

Is this rubble?



BOB

[with mouth full] It was just a little workout. Just to
stay loose.



HELEN

You know how I feel about that, Bob. Darn you! We can't
blow cover again!



BOB

The building was coming down anyway.



HELEN

What?! You knocked down a building?!



BOB

It was on fire. Structurally unsound. It was coming down
anyway.



HELEN

Tell me you haven't been listening to the police scanner
again?



BOB

Look, I performed a public service. You act like that's a
bad thing.



HELEN

It is a bad thing, Bob! Uprooting our family again, so you
can relive the glory days is a very bad thing.



BOB

Reliving the glory days is better than acting like they
didn't happen!



HELEN

Yes! They happened! But this, our family, is what's
happening now, Bob. And you are missing this! I can't believe you don't want to
go to your own son's graduation.



BOB

It's not a graduation. He's moving from the fourth grade to
the fifth grade.



HELEN

It's a ceremony!



BOB

It's psychotic! They keep creating new ways to celebrate
mediocrity but if someone is genuinely exceptional...



HELEN

This is not about you, Bob. This is about Dash.



BOB

You want to do something for Dash? Then let him actually
compete. Let him go out for sports!



HELEN

I will not be made the enemy here! You know why we can't do
that.



BOB

Because he'd be great!



HELEN

This is not about you!



BOB

All right, Dash. I know you're listening. Come on out.



HELEN

Vi? You, too, young lady.



BOB

Come on. Come on out. It's okay, kids. We're just having a
discussion.



VIOLET

Pretty loud discussion.



BOB

Yeah. But that's okay. Because what's important is that
Mommy and I are always a team. We're always united against, uh, the forces of,
uh...



HELEN

Pigheadedness?



BOB

I was gonna say evil or something.



HELEN

We're sorry we woke you. Everything's okay. Go back to bed.
It's late.



DASH

Good night, Mom. Night, Dad.



VIOLET

Good night.



HELEN

In fact, we should all be in bed.

Request claim on claim numbers 158183...



MR. HUPH [over the intercom]

Haven't you got him yet?! Where is he?!



HUPH'S SECRETARY [over the intercom]

Mr. Huph would like to talk to you in his office.



BOB

Now?



HUPH'S SECRETARY [over the intercom]

Now.



MR. HUPH

Sit down, Bob.



MR. HUPH

I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy. Ask me why.



BOB

Okay. Why?



MR. HUPH

Why what? Be specific, Bob.



BOB

Why are you unhappy?



MR. HUPH

Your customers make me unhappy.



BOB

What, you've gotten complaints?



MR. HUPH

Complaints I can handle. What I can't handle is your
customers' inexplicable knowledge of lnsuricare's inner workings! They're
experts. Experts, Bob! Exploiting every loophole, dodging every obstacle!
They're penetrating the bureaucracy!



BOB

Did I do something illegal?



MR. HUPH

No.



BOB

Are you saying we shouldn't help our customers?



MR. HUPH

The law requires that I answer no.



BOB

We're supposed to help people.



MR. HUPH

We're supposed to help our people! Starting with our
stockholders, Bob. Who's helping them out, huh? You know, Bob, a company...



BOB

Is like an enormous clock.



MR. HUPH

...is like an enormous clo--yes. Precisely. It only works if
all the little cogs mesh together. Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight. The best clocks have jewel movements, cogs
that fit, that cooperate by design. [chuckling] I'm being metaphorical, Bob.
You know what I mean by cooperative cogs? Bob? Bob? Look at me when I'm talking
to you, Parr!



BOB

That man out there, he needs help.



MR. HUPH

Do not change the subject, Bob. We're discussing your
attitude!



BOB

He is getting mugged!



MR. HUPH

Well, let's hope we don't cover him.



BOB

I'll be right back.



MR. HUPH

Stop right now or you're fired! Close the door. Get over
here, now.



MR. HUPH

I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.



BOB

He got away.



MR. HUPH

Good thing, too. You were this close to losing your jo--



BOB

Uh-oh.

BOB

How is he?



RICK

He'll live.



BOB

I'm fired, aren't I?



RICK

Oh, you think?



BOB

What can I say, Rick?



RICK

Nothing you haven't said before.



BOB

Someone was in trouble.



RICK

Someone's always in trouble.



BOB

I had to do something.



RICK

Yeah. Every time you say those words, it means a month and
a half of trouble for me, Bob. It means hundreds of thousands of taxpayer's
dollars.



BOB

I know.



RICK

We gotta pay to keep the company quiet. We gotta pay
damages, erase memories, relocate your family. Every time it gets harder.
Money, money, money, money. We can't keep doing this, Bob! We appreciate what
you did in the old days, but those days are over. From now on, you're on your
own.



RICK

Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you, you know, for old
times' sake.



BOB

No, I can't do that to my family. Everyone just got
settled. I'll make it work. Thanks.



RICK

Take care of yourself.



BOB

Well, what are you waiting for?



KID

I don't know. Something amazing, I guess.



BOB

[sighs] Me too, kid.

It's the TV, trying to watch.



MIRAGE

Because of its highly sensitive nature...

Well, stop trying. It's time for dinner.

Honey? About the job?

Something's happened.

The company is sending me to, uh, a conference.



HELEN

A conference?



BOB

[stammering] Out of town. And I'm just gonna be gone for a

HELEN

They've never sent you to a conference before. This is
good, isn't it?

[hesitating] Yes.

You see? They're finally recognizing your talents. You're
moving up.

Yes.

MIRAGE

The Omnidroid 9000 is a top secret prototype battle robot.
lts artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem it's confronted
with. And, unfortunately...



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Let me guess. It got smart enough to wonder why it had to
take orders.



MIRAGE

We lost control. And now it's loose in the jungle,
threatening our facility. We've had to evacuate all personnel from the island
for their own safety.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

How am I going in?



MIRAGE

The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate an air drop from 5000
feet. lts cloaking devices make it difficult to track. Although we're pretty
sure it's on the southern half of the island. One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

You want me to shut it down without completely destroying
it.



MIRAGE
You are Mr. lncredible.



MIRAGE

I've got to warn you, it's a learning robot. Every moment
you spend fighting it only increases its knowledge of how to beat you.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Shut it down. Do it quickly. Don't destroy it.



MIRAGE

And don't die.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Great. Thanks.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Showtime.

Actually, you look rather dashing.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I take it our host is...



MIRAGE

Oh, I'm sorry. He won't be dining with us. He hopes you'll
understand.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Of course. I do usually make it a point to know who I'm
working for.



MIRAGE

He prefers a certain amount of anonymity. Surely, you of
all people understand that.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

I was just wondering, of all the places to settle down, why
live...



MIRAGE

With a volcano? He's attracted to power. So am I. It's a
weakness we share.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

Seems a bit unstable.



MIRAGE

I prefer to think of it as misunderstood.



BOB (MR. INCREDIBLE)

[chuckling] Aren't we all?



MIRAGE

Volcanic soil is among the most fertile on Earth.
Everything at the table was grown right here. How does it compare?

21	Kung Fu Panda 	Jonathan Aibel,Glenn Berger	Animation,Action,Comedy,Family	June_2008	"EXT. VALLEY -- DAY
          
          A MYSTERIOUS WARRIOR treks across the rugged landscape.
          
                                NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     Legend tells of a legendary warrior
                     whose Kung Fu skills were the stuff
                     of legend.
          
          The warrior, his identity hidden beneath his flowing robe and
          wide-brimmed hat, gnaws on a staff of bamboo.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     He traveled the land in search of
                     worthy foes.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. BAR
          
          The warrior sits at a table drinking tea and gnawing on his
          bamboo. The door BLASTS open. The MANCHU GANG rushes in and
          surrounds him.
          
                                GANG BOSS
                         (to warrior)
                     I see you like to CHEW!
                         (beat)
                     Maybe you should chew on my FIST!!
          
          The Boss punches the table.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     The warrior said nothing for his
                     mouth was full. Then, he swallowed.
          
          He swallows.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     And then, he spoke.
          
                               WARRIOR
                         (dubbed hero voice)
                     Enough talk. Let's FIGHT!
                     SHASHABOOEY!
          
          WHAM! The warrior delivers a punch and the whole gang goes
          flying.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     He was so deadly in fact that his
                     enemies would go blind from
                     overexposure to pure awesomeness.
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
          The gang members blindly flail about.
          
                                NINJA CAT
                    MY EYES!
          
                              GATOR
                    HE'S TOO AWESOME!
          
          ONLOOKERS swoon.
          
                              SMITTEN BUNNY
                    And ATTRACTIVE!
          
                              GRATEFUL BUNNY
                    How can we repay you??
          
                              WARRIOR
                    There is no charge for awesomeness,
                    or attractiveness.
          
          ONE HUNDRED ASSASSINS appear and surround the warrior.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The entire bar swells, packed to the rafters with ninjas.
          
                                WARRIOR
                    KABLOOEY!
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The roof EXPLODES and a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky.
          Like a tornado, the warrior spins and knocks them all down.
          
                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    It mattered not how many foes he
                    faced. They were no match for his
                    bodacity.
          
          The warrior beats up a thousand ninjas, delivering his final
          blow while doing a split between two trees.
          
          The warrior stands amongst a field of vanquished foes as god-
          rays shine down upon him.
          
                              NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Never before had a panda been so
                    feared... and so loved.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                   3.
                                NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                      Even the most heroic heroes in all
                      of China, the Furious Five, bowed
                      in respect to this great master.
          
                                MONKEY
                      We should hang out.
          
                                 WARRIOR
                      Agreed.
          
          As the Five salute the warrior, he turns to see more bandits
          approaching. The Five strike an attack pose. The warrior
          brandishes a shiny green sword and leaps off the mountain
          into the sea of bandits.
          
                                NARRATOR (V.O.)
                      But hanging out would have to wait.
                      `Cause when you're facing the ten
                      thousand demons of Demon Mountain,
                      there's only one thing that
                      matters. And that's--
          
          In mid air, the Five talk to the warrior in a strange voice.
          
                                MONKEY
                      Po! Get up!
          
                                TIGRESS

          INT. PO'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Po lands hard on the floor. He tries to clear his head and
          wake up.
          
                                PO'S DAD (O.S.)
                      Po! Get up!
          
          We see his room is filled with various kung fu posters
          (including a poster featuring all of the Five) and souvenirs,
          and a wooden version of the Sword of Heroes (the green
          sword).
          
          Po SIGHS.
          
          He attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas, his belly
          is too worthy a foe.
          
                                PO'S DAD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                      Po! What are you doing up there?
          
                                                                      4.
          
          
                              PO
                    Uh, nothing!
          
          Po hops to his feet, imitating his Kung Fu action figures.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper!
                    Tigress! Rowrrrr...
          
          OUTSIDE on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig
          watering flowers stares at Po. Po tries to play it cool and
          then quickly ducks out of sight.
          
                              PO'S DAD (O.S.)
                    Po! Let's go! You're late for work!
          
                               PO
                    Coming!
          
          He takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the
          wall. It bounces off.
          
          He throws the star again, but it bounces off again. He picks
          it up and heads downstairs. He trips and falls the rest of
          the way.
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
          
          Po falls flat on his face on the kitchen floor. A panda-
          shaped shadow looms over Po.
          
                              PO
                    Sorry, Dad.

                    Sorry doesn't make the noodles.
          
          Reveal that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being
          carried by a small DUCK. This is PO'S DAD. Po gets to work,
          which is not easy since the kitchen's not really made for a
          panda his size.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    What were you doing up there? All
                    that noise.
          
                              PO
                    Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy
                    dream.
          
          He gets back to work.
          
                                                                      5.

                              PO'S DAD
                    The dream. What were you dreaming
                    about?
          
                              PO
                    What was I... eh, I was dreaming
                    about uh... heh...
          
          Push in on Po -- is he going to admit his dream? He hides his
          throwing star behind his back.
          
                               PO (CONT'D)
                    Noodles.
          
          THOK. Dad stops chopping vegetables.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Noodles. You were really dreaming
                    about noodles?
          
                              PO
                    Uh, yeah. What else would I be
                    dreaming about?
          
          Po hands a noodle bowl to a customer, then realizes his
          throwing star is sitting in it.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)

                              PO'S DAD
                    Oh, happy day! My son, finally
                    having the noodle dream!
          
          He throws his arms around Po.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    You don't know how long I have been
                    waiting for this moment.
          
          When Dad pulls out of the hug, Po is now wearing a noodle
          apron.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    This is a sign, Po!

          Po looks at the apron nervously -- what has he gotten himself
          into?
          
                              PO

                    from his father, who won it from a

                    No, it was the dream. We are noodle
                    folk. Broth runs through our veins.

                    I thought about running away and
                    learning how to make tofu.

                    Oh, because it was a stupid dream.
                    Can you imagine, me making tofu?
                        (laughs at the thought)
                    No. We all have our place in this
                    world. Mine is here. And yours is--

                    seven, and twelve.
          
          He loads Po's arms with bowls of soup.

          A GONG sounds in the distance. Po looks out the window at the
          distant JADE PALACE.
          
          
          EXT. JADE PALACE - DAY
          
          SLAM ZOOM in towards Palace.
          
          End next to palace on an old red panda (SHIFU) playing a
          FLUTE. He is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle
          between the Palace buildings.
          
          Wider: We dolly around from behind the bushes. Stealthy dark
          shapes move in the foreground.
          
          Back on Shifu, still playing. He seems oblivious.
          
          Five figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously,
          diving on Shifu.
          
          Shifu moves like lightning - the flute now wielded like a
          staff - he deflects, blocks, dodges, parries - the attackers
          go flying -
          
          They roll and pick themselves up, turning to face Shifu, who
          is now standing - poised - ready for their next move.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Well done, students... if you were
                    trying to disappoint me.
          
          He uses his flute to correct the Five's technique.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Tigress, you need more ferocity.
                    Monkey, greater speed.
          
          Each of the Five bows respectfully as their name is
          mentioned.
          
                                                                      8.
          
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Crane - height. Viper - subtlety.
                    Mantis--
          
          Shifu suddenly points the flute at a scared PALACE GOOSE.
          
                              ZENG
                    Master Shifu!
          
                              SHIFU
                        (impatiently)
                    What?!
          
                              ZENG
                        (startled)
                    Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants
                    to see you.
          
          Shifu looks up, concerned.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY
          
          Shifu strides purposefully down the hallway, which is lined
          with palace geese.
          
          
          INT. SCROLL ROOM - DAY
          
          Candles, incense, and smoke fill the room. The door bursts
          open, the candles flicker. Shifu enters.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Master Oogway? You summoned me.
          
          He bows. Then looks up without unbowing.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Is something wrong?
          
          Reveal Master Oogway... a wise, old tortoise.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Why must something be wrong for me
                    to want to see my old friend?
          
                              SHIFU
                    So... nothing's wrong?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Well, I didn't say that.
          
          Shifu looks up, concerned. Oogway opens his mouth... and
          blows out a candle. And another candle. And another.
          
                                                                     9.
          
          
          Finally, Shifu uses his Kung Fu to blow them all out. Oogway
          smiles knowingly.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You were saying?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I have had a vision... Tai Lung
                    will return.
          
          Shifu looks stricken.
          
          
          FLASHBACK - INT. SCROLL ROOM
          
          Quick, impressionistic images of Shifu battling a large,
          shadowy figure (Tai Lung).
          
          
          PRESENT - INT. SCROLL ROOM
          
          Shifu is rattled. He looks at the claw marks that still scar
          the wall and quickly looks away. But he regains his
          composure.
          
                              SHIFU
                    That is impossible. He is in
                    prison.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Nothing is impossible.
          
          Shifu makes a split decision.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Zeng!
          
          He comes flying in. Shifu gets in his face.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them
                    to double the guards, double their
                    weapons. Double everything! Tai
                    Lung does not leave that prison!
          
                              ZENG
                    Yes, Master Shifu.
          
          The goose flies off, but... SMACK! He hits a column. Then he
          is off. Back on Oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from
          Shifu.
          
                                                                   10.
          
          
                              OOGWAY
                    One often meets his destiny on the
                    road he takes to avoid it.
          
                              SHIFU
                    We have to do something. We can't
                    just let him march on the valley,
                    and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--
          
          Oogway looks into the water of the moon pool.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Your mind is like this water, my
                    friend. When it is agitated, it
                    becomes difficult to see. But if
                    you allow it to settle, the answer
                    becomes clear.
          
          Shifu and Oogway stare into the pool. Oogway settles the
          water, revealing the reflection of an intricately carved
          dragon clutching a SCROLL in its mouth.
          
                              SHIFU
                    The Dragon Scroll...
          
                              OOGWAY
                    It is time.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But who? Who is worthy to be
                    trusted with the secret to
                    limitless power? To become...the
                    Dragon Warrior?!
          
          Dramatic music as we push in on Oogway's face. Then...
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I don't know.
          
          
          INT. NOODLE SHOP - DAY
          
          Po is serving customers, but has trouble squeezing between
          tables.

          He sucks his belly in, but this causes his butt to interfere
          with a bunny family's meal.

          Other customers are finishing their soup.
          
          One old lady customer slowly counts out coins and puts them
          on the table.

          Throngs of Villagers are streaming into the arena. A couple
          BUNNY KIDS run by.

                    Me too!
          
          Where's Po?
          
          PAN DOWN a long, long, long, long flight of stairs. Po stands
          at the bottom with his noodle cart, looking up at the
          daunting task before him.
          
          Po struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs.
          
                                                                   13.
          
          
          The sun beats down on Po, but he presses forward. Climbing.
          Climbing.

          He stops, flopping onto his back to catch his breath.
          
          WIDEN TO REVEAL he's only made it up seven steps.

                                 KG SHAW
                    Sorry, Po.

                    We'll bring you back a souvenir.
          
          Po watches as they run up the stairs. His eyes narrow. This
          is his heroic moment.
          
                              PO
                    No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.
          
          Po tosses off his hat and apron and begins his ascent up the
          stairs.
          
          
          EXT. JADE PALACE - ARENA PLATFORM
          
          Oogway reaches the bottom of the palace stairs and a Palace
          Pig bangs a gong.
          
                              SHIFU
                    It is an historic day, isn't it,
                    Master Oogway?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Yes, and one I feared I would not
                    live to see. Are your students
                    ready?
          
                                                                 14.
          
          
                              SHIFU
                    Yes, Master Oogway.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Now know this, old friend. Whomever
                    I choose will not only bring peace
                    to the Valley, but also to you.
          
          As Shifu contemplates what this could mean, Oogway starts
          walking off. Shifu quickly joins Oogway as they head towards
          the roaring crowd below. The pig bangs the gong.

          EXT. TOP OF STAIRS - DAY
          
          Po gasps for air as he hoists himself over the last step,
          laughing victoriously.

                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Hey! Open the door!
          
          DRUMS inside drown out Po's pounding. He yells.
          
                                 PO (CONT'D)
                    Let me in!
          
          Inside, spectators' screams drown out Po's yelling.
          
          Po panics for a beat and then finds a window. He jumps and
          weakly struggles to pull himself up.
          
          Po struggles to peek through the window.
          
                                                                  15.

                     you... Tigress! Viper! Crane!
                     Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five!
          
          The Five jump into the middle of the ring.

          Po manages a brief glimpse of the Five before a gust of wind
          knocks Po to the ground and shuts the window.
          
                               SHIFU
                     Warriors prepare!
          
          Po runs over to a crack in the wall.

          Inside the arena, Po catches a glimpse of Crane as he spreads
          his wings.

          One of the spectators walks in front of Po, cutting off his
          view.
          
                               PIG FAN

          Po backs up to get a better look at Crane in the sky and
          accidentally falls down the stairs.
          
          Po climbs back up and drops his head -- he missed it.
          
          MONTAGE:
          
          Po tries karate chopping the door open...to no avail. He
          slumps to the ground.

          Po attempts a pole vault, but falls on his back. The pole
          whips around and hits him into the arena wall.
          
          Po rigs a catapult, only to get clobbered by it. The crowd
          CHEERS.
          
          Po sits atop the stairs. Alone.

          Tigress sets up to deliver her move.
          
          Po launches himself up above the fence, gets a peek at
          Tigress, then falls out of view just as she does her move.
          
          Po lands outside the arena in a fireworks tent.

          On the awesome WB LOGO made of LEGO bricks. We PUSH
          through it and find ourselves in a STARFIELD.
                         
          A COMET streaks towards us. We FOLLOW as it blasts past.
          The ground plane rushes up to camera. BLACK.

           No one knows where it came from.
           There had been others. Mysterious
           relics of another world. But only
           one with the power to stop the
           world.
                         
          SHKBOOM!!! The comet makes impact! A LEGO explosion!
          We peer into the smoking crater. Fire amid blackness.

           Many vied for its dark magic. A
           few brave souls endeavoured to
           hide it from those who would use
           it for ill. Until finally,
           thankfully it was lost to history.
                         
          Suddenly, we are blinded by a powerful TUNNEL OF LIGHT.
          It's an animated LEGO version of the light tunnel in
          2001, which was directed by Stanley Kubrick, who knows a
          thing or two about making movies, so don't step.
                         
          We push forwards, headed into a new world.

           Ours is a story of a world that
           knows not where it comes from.
           That cannot imagine what it is
           capable of. Perhaps you can
           relate. I know I can.

          The most killer looking ancient vine-encrusted jungle
          temple of all time. The whole thing is made of LEGO.

          REVEAL LEGO INDIANA JONES and two GUIDES. Indy puts up a
          hand for them to stop. He removes a RUBY RED PIECE from
          his bag and connects it to the temple. The piece GLOWS.
                         
          A dark passageway opens, and Indy lights a torch. The
          flames are made of ANIMATED LEGO BRICKS. The guides are
          too scared to continue. Indy's not.
                         
                         
          INT. AWESOME TEMPLE - DUSK
                         
          A beautiful room made entirely of GOLDEN BRICKS. In the
          center is a GOLDEN SARCOPHAGUS guarded by statues of gods
          from every ancient civilization imaginable.
                         
          Indy carefully lifts a tablet from a statue of Zeus and
          places it into the sarcophagus like an ATM card. He
          pushes a bunch of cuneiform buttons - a PIN NUMBER.
                         
          The sarcophagus opens. A white-hot glow on Indy's face.
                         
          BLAM!!! The entire room shakes. The statues are blown
          apart!
                         
          The smoke clears. Enter THE BLACK FALCON, the most evil
          person in the universe. He's flanked by ROBOT guards.
                         
                          INDY
           The Black Falcon. I should've
           known.
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
           Hey Indy. Uch. Who built this
           place? Must have been a bunch of
           lazy hippies, sitting around a
           table agreeing with each other.
                         
                          INDY
           It was built by the ancients.
           With more wisdom and artistry than
           you can ever know.
                         
          The Black Falcon basks in the glow of the sarcophagus.
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
           The Kragle...
                         
                          INDY
           That belongs to the Maker. It
           must be protected!
           3.
                         
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
           What a lame boyscout thing to say!
           You're standing before the most
           powerful object in the world and
           you don't want to use it? You're a
           real nerd, Indiana Jones.
                         
          The BF motions and his guards carry the sarcophagus away.
                         
                          INDY
           The MasterBuilders will learn of
           this.
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
           And what do you know of them?
                         
                          INDY
           Only that they will be your
           undoing.
                         
                          BLACK FALCON
           Adieu, Dr. Jones. That's French
           for ciao.
                         
          He exits. As the sarcophagus crosses the threshold of
          the temple, walls shake. The temple is CRUMBLING.
                         
          Left for dead, Indy uses the falling pieces to build
          himself a sweet rocket ship and blasts out of the temple.
          Narrowly avoiding a big rolling LEGO ball, probably.
                         
                         
          EXT. FIELD - DAY
                         
          A farmhouse in the hills. Indy rolls up and pulls the
          teat of a goat, which opens a SECRET DOOR.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTERBUILDERS SECRET HIDEOUT - DAY
                         
          Art studio meets SuperFriends headquarters. Badasses are
          MEDITATING, including GEMINI, a mysterious cloaked
          figure, and KRAV M'GA, the boss. Indy bursts in.
                         
          PUSH IN dramatically:
                         
                          INDY
           The Black Falcon has the Kragle.
                         
          PUSH IN dramatically:
                         
                          KRAV M'GA
           Gemini. Find the Chosen One.

          PUSH IN dramatically:
                         
                          GEMINI
           Okay.
                         
          BOOM. Something big just landed outside. Indy looks at
          his foot. Attached is a blinking red brick. Oh no.
                         
                          INDY
           They followed me...
                         
                          KRAV M'GA
                          (TO GEMINI)
           GO! NOW!
                         
          CRASH! It's a full scale assault by hundreds of ROBOTS.
          The MasterBuilders fight valiantly but are overwhelmed.
                         
          Gemini runs from the fight, then stumbles, overcome with
          emotion as we hear the battle being lost. Amid the
          screams, Krav M'Ga's final words echo through Gemini's
          head...
                         
           KRAV M'GA (V.O.)
           Find the Chosen One...

           Emmet!
                         
          DORIS, a dowdy mom, calls through her son's door.
                         
                          DORIS
           Did you clean your room?! The
           cleaning woman is coming today!
                         
           EMMET (O.S.)
           Then why do I need to clean?
                         
                          DORIS
           Because I want her to know what a
           nice rule-following son I have!
                         
          Doris walks into his meticulously clean room to find
          Emmet, 22, a total square, in his underpants.
                         
                          EMMET
           Mom!
                         
                          DORIS
           Aw, it is clean.
           5.
                         
                         
                          EMMET
           It's always clean!
                         
                          DORIS
                          (CHOKING UP)
           Just like I taught you.
                         
                          EMMET
           What's the point of having my own
           apartment across the hall from
           your apartment if you're going to
           check up on me like I still live
           at home?
                         
          Emmet ""pulls"" on a pair of mini-fig legs. Replaces his
          torso with a shirt. Takes off his hair and puts on a
          construction hat. Ready for work. Doris is so proud.
                         
                          DORIS
           I just love you and want my son to
           be safe and happy. Can't you work
           from home? Like a sociopath or
           children's book author?
                         
                          EMMET
           Mom. I've spent my whole life
           here. I need to go out there and
           follow my dream of fitting in and
           being like everybody else.
                         
                          DORIS
           My boy. All grown up. Maybe soon
           you'll meet a girl and be married!
                         
                          EMMET
           Mom, please!
                         
                          DORIS
           I'm just saying, it's been how
           many years since Lucy?
                         
                          EMMET
           (changing the subject)
           Mom... I had the dream again.

          EMMET'S RECURRING DREAM: A middle school classroom.
          Everyone wears blue. Young Emmet wears red. The ART
          TEACHER walks around, commenting.
           6.
                         
                         
           EMMET (V.O.)
           It was the same as it always is.
           Seared in my memory...
                         
          Everyone dutifully draws the same drawing of a hand, but
          Emmet draws two hands close together so they look like
          eyes. He draws a mouth and pupils. The teacher stops.
                         
           BAD ART TEACHER
           Emmet. This wasn't the assignment.
           You've got to learn to follow the
           rules.
                         
          She holds up Emmet's drawing for all to see.
                         
           BAD ART TEACHER
           Everyone, the assignment is to
           draw your hand, not a silly face.

          INT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Emmet sits alone, crying. The other kids sit at other
          tables and whisper...
                         
                          KIDS
           That's the guys who drew a face. /
           What a weirdo. / He doesn't know
           how to follow instructions. / He's
           not invited to my birthday.
                         
          Emmet ERASES his drawing, a pariah. A little GIRL looks
          at him from afar with sympathy.
                         
          BACK TO SCENE
                         
                          DORIS
           I hated that day. The kids were so
           mean, the school tried to expel
           you... I promised myself I'd never
           let anything like that happen to
           you again. And it hasn't. So you
           need to let your memory of that
           day go. It never happened.
                         
                          EMMET
           I just want to be normal, Mom.
                         
                          DORIS
           Listen. You're my son. And you're
           the most normal, regular, average
           person I know.

           You mean it?
                         
                          DORIS
           Yeah.
                         
                          EMMET
           Are you crying?
                         
                          DORIS
           No. Yes. Emmet...
                         
          She wants to tell him something, but thinks better of it.
                         
                          DORIS
           Don't forget dinner.
                         
                          EMMET
           Promise.
                         
                          DORIS
           Be safe.
                         
                          EMMET
           Of course.
                         
                          DORIS
           Don't make waves.
                         
                          EMMET
           I never do.
                         
                          DORIS
           And follow the instructions.
                         
                          EMMET
           Always.
                         
                          DORIS
           If they weren't so firm and flush
           with your head, I would pinch your
           cheeks right now.
                         
                          EMMET
           Love you, Mom.
                         
                          DORIS
           Love you.
                         
                         
          He EXITS, leaving her alone in the room. She SIGHS.

          EXT. LEGOPOLIS - DAY
                         
          Emmet drives into the most elaborate LEGO city set ever.
          Everywhere are dozens of STREET SIGNS offering detailed
          instructions for what you should and shouldn't do.
          Everyone drives the same speed in the same direction,
          listening to the same station, moving to the same beat.
                         
          MUSIC: An insanely catchy pop song.
                         
                          RADIO DJ
           It's another beautiful day in
           Legopolis and on Empura Radio.
           Reminding you don't forget to re-
           elect President Iamnotarobot for
           President of the City on Tuesday.
           Now, for the 258th consecutive
           week at #1, here's the No News
           Gnus with their hit ""Everything is
           Awesome.""
                         
                          EMMET
           Yeah. I love this song! And so
           does everyone else!
                         
          In what feels like a musical number, Emmet drives past
          vignettes of citizens happily going about their day and
          loving this song! BILLBOARDS everywhere advertise
          EMPURA, a company which apparently owns everything.
                         
                         
          EXT. ALTERNATIVE AVENUE - DAY
                         
          Everyone walks in the same direction and goes in to
          various identical-seeming coffee shops.

          INT. KREATIVE KOFFEE - DAY
                         
          A Starbucks by a different name. Mixed with a Hot Dog on
          a Stick. Emmet arrives at the counter.
                         
                          EMMET
           Hello.
                         
                          BARRISTA
           What'll it be?
                         
                          EMMET
           I'm Emmet.
           9.
                         
                         
                          BARRISTA
          Larry?
                         
                          EMMET
          Well, Larry, I'll have one coffee
          please.
                         
                          BARRISTA
          Cappuccino, macchiato, espresso,
          americano.
                         
                          EMMET
          What are those? Sounds a little
          foofy.
                         
                          BARRISTA
          They're all coffee.
                         
                          EMMET
          Oh. Well, whatever isn't too wild.
          I don't know, what do you think?
                          (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
                         
                          BARRISTA
          A decaf.
                         
                          EMMET
          Okay, yeah. Cool.
                         
                          BARRISTA
          Venti, Grande, or Super Grande?
                         
                          EMMET
          Oh, goodness. So much selection.
          So hard to decide! You pick.
                         
                          BARRISTA
          That's a personal decision that
          only you can make.
                         
                          EMMET
          Uh. Gosh, which is the most
          popular?
                         
                          BARRISTA
          Super Grande. It's Italian for
          medium.
                         
                          EMMET
          Medium. That's what I'm havin'!
          That is my style.
                         
                          BARRISTA
          Fantastic.
           10.
                         
                         
                          EMMET
           You creative types! So
           delightfully sardonic!
                         
                          BARRISTA
           I push one of two buttons on a
           machine. I would hardly call that
           creative. I would call that
           following instructions.
                         
                          EMMET
           But it says Kreative right on your
           shirt! With an extra ""kreative""
           spelling aberration! I totally
           don't get it!
                         
                         
          EXT. ALTERNATIVE AVENUE - DAY
                         
          As Emmet exits the shop and passes an EMPURA billboard
          asking him to reelect President Iamnotarobot.
                         
          A television in a shop window shows highlights of a
          debate between Iamnotarobot and Stooge Strawman.
                         
          Emmet finishes the drive to work. Everyone pulls into
          their parking spaces at the same time, like clockwork.
                         
          Emmet walks out and looks at his new work place. His
          breath is taken away as he gazes on a beautiful...
                         
                         
          EXT. INSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
                         
          A fantastical construction site. Super-awesome cranes.
          Emmet walks and talks to his new boss.
                         
                          FOREMAN
           Alright, kid. Here's the rules.
                         
                          EMMET
           Ooh, great.
                         
                          FOREMAN
           Stay on your feet--
                         
                          EMMET
           Mmm hmm.
                         
                          FOREMAN
           Stick to the instructions--
                         
                          EMMET
           Uh huh.
           11.
                         
                         
                          FOREMAN
           And don't get creative!
                         
          Emmet GUFFAWS like that's the craziest idea ever.
                         
                          EMMET
           Oh, Steve, don't worry. I'm not
           some kind of foofy weirdo, Steve!
                         
          The laugh together for a LONG TIME. Then,
                         
                          FOREMAN
           It's Sean.
                         
                         
          EXT. INSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          They walk past BIG STACKS OF PIECES moved by MACHINES.
                         
                          FOREMAN
           The pieces get sent down from
           corporate bundled together with
           the instructions. Take the one
           with your section on it and follow
           it to the letter. Keep track of
           all the pieces. If you lose one of
           the special ones it'll seriously
           drive you crazy.
                         
                         
          EXT. INSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          They casually step across girders high above the city.
                         
                          FOREMAN
           Today you'll be putting together
           an artists' loft.
                         
                          EMMET
           Is it for an artist?
                         
                          FOREMAN
           Oh, no. It's for an accountant.
                         
                          EMMET
           Oh, great.
                         
                          FOREMAN
           Pretty soon, the whole city will
           look like this. All part of some
           big master plan from Central.
                         
                          EMMET
           Wow...
           12.
                         
                         
          They arrive at the COOLEST CONSTRUCTION MACHINE EVER.
          Emmet opens up his actual size LEGO instructions.
                         
                          EMMET
           What if I mess up or lose my place
           or something?
                         
                          FOREMAN
           Just do what everyone else does.
           Keep your head down, follow
           instructions, and you could get
           promoted. Central's got some big
           project coming up overseas.
                         
                          EMMET
           Overseas? I don't know. I'm not
           big on travel.
                         
                          FOREMAN
           Whatever, kid.
                         
                          EMMET
           One more question.
                         
          Emmet puts a hand on his shoulder.
                         
                          EMMET
           Thank you. For making my dreams
           come true.
                         
                          FOREMAN
           Is that a question?
                         
                         
          EXT. INSTRUCTION SITE - LATER
                         
          Emmet puts his hands on the controls, savoring this
          moment, and finally puts his first brick in, according to
          the plan. It's an awesome feeling. Another. Another.
          He gets in the zone of building. This feels right.
                         
                         
          EXT. INSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
                         
          Lunchtime. Emmet looks at a heart-shaped COOKIE his mom
          baked for him. ""I love you"" in frosting. He flips it
          over. ""Be Safe!"" He looks over to the other INSTRUCTION
          WORKERS, eating lunch.
                         
                          EMMET
           So.
                         
          Silence.
           13.
                         
                         
                          EMMET
          How about that local sports team?
          What do you think of how they
          played the other day?
                         
                          LUNCH CONSUMER
          Ugh, they were awful.
                         
                          EMMET
          Right? They should make a
          personnel change of some kind.
                         
                          LUNCH CONSUMER
                         THAT COACH--
                         
                          EMMET
          Yes, the coach!
                         
                          LUNCH CONSUMER
          He's the only good thing about
          that team.

          Emmet is back to building. He takes a look at the city
          from the highest height. It's beautiful. He's downright
          INSPIRED looking at it. He sees the LEGO brick clouds in
          the sky slowly form the shape of a FACE.
                         
          We ZOOM IN to Emmet's MIND. We see LEGO SYNAPSES firing.
          A CONNECTION between two halves of the brain. An IDEA.
                         
          We pull back to REVEAL that Emmet has accidentally built,
          instead of a window, a SMILING FACE, reminiscent of the
          one he drew in class all that time ago.

           just looking out at the clouds,
           and-- It was an accident.
                         
          The Foreman picks up the phone.

          Just then, A CRANE OPERATOR notices the happy face. His
          distraction causes the crane to go in the wrong direction
          and SMASH a wall. The falling bricks cause an elaborate
          chain reaction that tips the structure over.

  From the fog a ship appears crashing through the waves)

Sailors: I'll tell you a tale of the bottomless blue
  And it's hey to the starboard, heave ho
  Look out, lad, a mermaid be waitin' for you
  In mysterious fathoms below.
Eric: Isn't this great?  The salty sea air, the wind blowing in your face . . .
  a perfect day to be at sea!
Grimsby: (Leaning over side.) Oh yes . . . delightful . . . .
Sailor 1: A fine strong wind and a following sea.  King Triton must be in a
  friendly-type mood.
Eric: King Triton?
Sailor 2: Why, ruler of the merpeople, lad.  Thought every good sailor knew
  about him.
Grimsby: Merpeople!  Eric, pay no attention to this nautical nonsense.
Sailor 2: But it ain't nonsense, it's the truth!  I'm tellin' you, down in the
  depths o' the ocean they live. (He gestures wildly, Fish in his hand flops
  away and lands back in the ocean, relieved.)
Sailors: Heave. ho. Heave, ho. In mysterious fathoms below. (Fish sighs and
  swims away.)

     (Titles. Various fish swimming. Merpeople converge on a great undersea
palace, filling concert hall inside. Fanfare ensues.)

Seahorse: Ahem . . . His royal highness, King Triton! (Triton enters
  dramatically to wild cheering.) And presenting the distinguished court
  composer, Horatio Thelonious Ignatius Crustaceous Sebastian! (Sebastion
  enters to mild applause.)
Triton: I'm really looking forward to this performance, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Oh, Your Majesty, this will be the finest concert I have ever con-
  ducted.  Your daughters - they will be spectacular!
Triton: Yes, and especially my little Ariel.
Sebastian: Yes, yes, she has the most beautiful voice. . . .  [sotto] If only
  she'd show up for rehearsals once in a while. . . . (He proceeds to podium
  and begins to direct orchestra.)
Triton's daughters: Ah, we are the daughters of Triton.
  Great father who loves us and named us well:
  Aquata, Andrina, Arista, Atina, Adella, Allana.
  And then there is the youngest in her musical debut,
  Our seventh little sister, we're presenting her to you,
  To sing a song Sebastian wrote, her voice is like a bell,
  She's our sister, Ar-i . . .
  (Shell opens to reveal that Ariel is absent.)
Triton: (Very angry.) Ariel!!

      (Cut to Ariel looking at sunken ship.)

Flounder: (From distance.) Ariel, wait for me . . .
Ariel: Flounder, hurry up!
Flounder: (Catching up.) You know I can't swim that fast.
Ariel: There it is.  Isn't it fantastic?
Flounder: Yeah . . . sure . . . it - it's great.  Now let's get outta here.
Ariel: You're not getting cold fins now, are you?
Flounder: Who, me?  No way.  It's just, it, err . . . it looks - damp in there.
  Yeah.  And I think I may be coming down with something.  Yeah, I got this
  cough. (Flounder coughs unconvincingly)
Ariel: All right.  I'm going inside.  You can just stay here and - watch for
  sharks. (She goes inside.)
Flounder: O.K.  Yeah - you go.  I'll stay and - what?  Sharks!  Ariel!
  (He tries to fit through porthole.) Ariel . . . I can't . . . I mean-
  Ariel help!
Ariel: (Laughs.) Oh, Flounder.
Flounder: (Wispering.)Ariel, do you really think there might be sharks around
  here? (Shark passes outside.)
Ariel: Flounder, don't be such a guppy.
Flounder: I'm not a guppy. (Gets pulled through porthole.)This is great - I
  mean, I really love this.  Excitement, adventure, danger lurking around
  every corn- YAAAAHHHHHHHH!! Ariel!! (He sees a skull, crashes into pillar
  causing cave in, and swims frantically away, knocking over Ariel.)
Ariel: Oh, are you okay?
Flounder: Yeah sure, no problem, I'm okay . . .
Ariel: Shhh . . . (Seeing a fork.) Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Have you ever
  seen anything so wonderful in your entire life?
Flounder: Wow, cool!  But, err, what is it?
Ariel: I don't know.  But I bet Scuttle will.
  (Puts fork in bag. Skark swims by outside.)
Flounder: What was that? Did you hear something?
Ariel: (Distracted by pipe.) Hmm, I wonder what this one is?
Flounder: Ariel . .
Ariel: Flounder, will you relax. Nothing is going to happen.
Flounder: (Seeing Shark looming behind him.) AAHHHH!! Run!! Run!! We're
  gonna die!! (Shark chases them all around. Ariel's bag is hung up. She
  goes back for it. Shark almost gets them. They head for porthole.) Oh No!!
  (They crash through and go round and round. Flounder gets knocked silly
  but Ariel saves him and traps Shark) You big bully. THBBBTTTT . . .
  (Shark snaps at him and he swims away.)
Ariel: (Laughing.) Flounder, you really are a guppy.
Flounder: I am not.

     (On surface. Scuttle on his island humming and looking through his
telescope.)

Ariel: Scuttle!
Scuttle: (Looking through the telescope the wrong way, shouting.) Whoa!
   Mermaid off the port bow! Ariel, how you doin' kid? (Lowers telescope to
   reveal Ariel at wing's length.) Whoa, what a swim!
Ariel: Scuttle - look what we found.
Flounder: Yeah - we were in this sunken ship - it was really creepy.
Scuttle: Human stuff, huh?  Hey, lemme see. (Picks up fork.) Look at this.
  Wow - this is special - this is very, very unusual.
Ariel: What?  What is it?
Scuttle: It's a dinglehopper! Humans use these little babies . . . to
  straighten their hair out. See - just a little twirl here an' a yank
  there and - voiolay!  You got an aesthetically pleasing configuration
  of hair that humans go nuts over!
Ariel: A dinglehopper!
Flounder: What about that one?
Scuttle: (Holding pipe) Ah - this I haven't seen in years.  This is wonderful!
  A banded, bulbous - snarfblat.
Ariel and Flounder: Oohhh.
Scuttle: Now, the snarfblat dates back to prehistorical times, when humans used
  to sit around, and stare at each other all day.  Got very boring.  So, they
  invented the snarfblat to make fine music.  Allow me.
  (Scuttle blows into the pipe; seaweed pops out the other end.)
Ariel: Music?  Oh, the concert! Oh my gosh, my father's gonna kill me!
Flounder: The concert was today?
Scuttle: (Still contemplating pipe.) Maybe you could make a little planter
  out of it or somethin'.
Ariel: Uh, I'm sorry, I've gotta go. Thank you Scuttle. (Waves.)
Scuttle: Anytime sweetie, anytime.

     (Cut to Flotsam and Jetsam, then Ursula in background watching magic
projection of Ariel swimming.)

Ursula: Yeeeeeees, hurry home, princess.  We wouldn't want to miss old daddy's
  celebration, now, would we?  Huh!  Celebration indeed.  Bah!  In MY day, we
  had fantastical feasts when I lived in the palace.  And now, look at me -
  wasted away to practically nothing - banished and exiled and practically
  starving, while he and his flimsy fish-folk celebrate.  Well, I'll give 'em
  something to celebrate soon enough.  Flotsam!  Jetsam!  I want you to keep an
  extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his.  She may be the key
  to Triton's undoing. . . .

     (Fade to the palace throne room where Ariel is being admonished.)

Triton: I just don't know what we're going to do with you, young lady.
Ariel: Daddy, I'm sorry, I just forgot, I -
Triton: As a result of your careless behaviour -
Sebastian: Careless and reckless behaviour!
Triton: - the entire celebration was, er -
Sebastian: Well, it was ruined!  That's all.  Completely destroyed! This
  concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career. Now thanks to
  you I am the laughing stock of the entire kingdom!
Flounder: But it wasn't her fault! Ah - well - first, ahh, this shark chased us
  - yeah - yeah!  And we tried to - but we couldn't - and - grrrrrrrrr - and -
  and we - whoooaaaaaa - oh, and then we were safe. But then this seagull came,
  and it was this is this, and that is that, and -
Triton: Seagull?  What?  Oh - you went up to the surface again, didn't you?
  DIDN'T YOU?
Ariel: Nothing - happened. . . .
Triton: Oh, Ariel, How many times must we go through this?  You could've been
  seen by one of those barbarians - by - by one of those humans!
Ariel: Daddy, they're not barbarians!
Triton: They're dangerous.  Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter
  snared by some fish-eater's hook?
Ariel: I'm sixteen years old - I'm not a child anymore -
Triton: Don't you take that tone of voice with me young lady.  As long as you
  live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules!
Ariel: But if you would just listen -
Triton: Not another word - and I am never, NEVER to hear of you going to the
  surface again.  Is that clear? (Ariel leaves, crying.)
Sebastian: Hm! Teenagers. . . .  They think they know everything.  You give
  them an inch, they swim all over you.
Triton: Do you, er, think I - I was too hard on her?
Sebastian: Definitely not.  Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I'd show her who was
  boss.  None of this ""flitting to the surface"" and other such nonsense.  No,
  sir - I'd keep her under tight control.
Triton: You're absolutely right, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Of course.
Triton: Ariel needs constant supervision.
Sebastian: Constant.
Triton: Someone to watch over her - to keep her out of trouble.
Sebastian: All the time -
Triton: And YOU are just the crab to do it.

     (Cut to Sebastion walking down corridor.)

Sebastian: How do I get myself into these situations?  I should be writing
  symphonies - not tagging along after some headstrong teenager. (Sees Ariel
  and Flounder sneaking off and follows.) Hmm? What is that girl up to? (He
  barely makes it into cave and sees Ariel's collection.) Huh?
Flounder: Ariel, are you okay?
Ariel: If only I could make him understand.  I just don't see things the way he
  does. I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things - could be
  bad.

   Look at this stuff
   Isn't it neat?
   Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
   Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
   The girl who has ev'rything?
   Look at this trove
   Treasures untold
   How many wonders can one cavern hold?
   Lookin' around here you'd think
   Sure, she's got everything

   I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
   I've got whozits and whatzits galore
   (You want thingamabobs?
   I got twenty)
   But who cares?
   No big deal
   I want more

   I wanna be where the people are
   I wanna see
   Wanna see 'em dancin'
   Walkin' around on those
   (Whad'ya call 'em?) oh - feet
   Flippin' your fins you don't get too far
   Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'
   Strollin' along down a
   (What's that word again?) street

   Up where they walk
   Up where they run
   Up where they stay all day in the sun
   Wanderin' free
   Wish I could be
   Part of that world

   What would I give
   If I could live
   Outta these waters?
   What would I pay
   To spend a day
   Warm on the sand?
   Betcha on land
   They understand
   Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
   Bright young women
   Sick o' swimmin'
   Ready to stand

   And ready to know what the people know
   Ask 'em my questions
   And get some answers
   What's a fire and why does it
   (What's the word?) burn?

   When's it my turn?
   Wouldn't I love
   Love to explore that shore above?
   Out of the sea
   Wish I could be
   Part of that world

  (Sebastion has been struggling around and now comes crashing down making
  a lot of noise.)
Ariel: Sebastion!?
Sebastian: Ariel - what, are you mad?  How could you - what is all this?
Ariel: It, err, it's just my - collection. . . .
Sebastian: Oh.  I see.  Your collection.  Hmmm.  IF YOUR FATHER KNEW ABOUT THIS
  PLACE HE'D -
Flounder: You're not gonna tell him, are you?
Ariel: Oh, please, Sebastian, he would never understand.
Sebastian: Ariel.  You're under a lot of pressure down here.  Come with me,
  I'll take you home and get you something warm to drink. (A ship passes by
  overhead.)
Ariel: What do you suppose?. . .
Sebastion: Ariel? Ariel!

     (On surface. Fireworks in the sky around ship. Ariel looks on,
amazed. Sebastion and Flounder arrive.)

Sebastion: Ariel, what - what are you- jumpin' jellyfish! Ariel, Ariel!
  Please come back! (Ariel swims to ship and watches party until Max finds
  her.)
Eric: (Whistles.) Max, here boy. Hey, come on, mutt, whatcha doing, huh
  Max? Good boy. (Ariel sees him and is stricken.)
Scuttle: Hey there, sweetie!  Quite a show, eh?
Ariel: Scuttle, be quiet!  They'll hear you.
Scuttle: Oooh, I gotcha, I gotcha.  We're being intrepidatious.  WE'RE OUT TO
  DISCOVER! (Ariel grabs his beak.)
Ariel: I've never seen a human this close before.  Oh - he's very handsome,
  isn't he?
Scuttle: (Looking at Max) I dunno, he looks kinda hairy and slobbery to me.
Ariel: Not that one - the one playing the snarfblat.
Grimsby: Silence!  Silence!  It is now my honour and privilege to present our
  esteemed Prince Eric with a very special, very expensive, very large birthday
  present.
Eric: Ah, Grimsby - y'old beanpole, you shouldn't have.
Grimsby: I know. Happy birthday, Eric! (Large, gaudy statue of Eric is
  revealed. Max growls.)
Eric: Gee, Grim.  It's, err, it's, err - it's really somethin'. . . .
Grimsby: Yes, I commissioned it myself.  Of course, I had hoped it would be a
  wedding present, but . . .
Eric: Come on, Grim, don't start.  Look, you're not still sore because I didn't
  fall for the princess of Glauerhaven, are you?
Grimsby: Oh, Eric, it isn't me alone.  The entire kingdom wants to see you
  happily settled down with the right girl.
Eric: Well, she's out there somewhere.  I just - I just haven't found her yet.
Grimsby: Well, perhaps you haven't been looking hard enough.
Eric: Believe me, Grim, when I find her I'll know - without a doubt.  It'll
  just - bam! - hit me - like lightning. (Lightning and thunder appear and the
  sky grows dark.)
Sailor: Hurricane a'commin'!! Stand fast! Secure the riggin'! (Storm hits.)
Scuttle: Whoa! The wind's all of a sudden on the move here. (He is blown
  away.) Oh! Ariel . . . (Ship crashes through storm. Lightning starts a fire.
  A rock looms ahead.)
Eric: Look out! . . . (Ship crashes and all are thrown overboard except Max.)
  Grim, hang on! (Sees Max.) Max! (Goes back to save him.) Jump Max! Come
  on boy, jump! You can do it Max. (He saves Max but is trapped on board.)
Grimsby: ERIC! (Ship explodes. Ariel finds Eric near drowning and pulls him
  away.)

     (On beach. Ariel is sitting next to an unconscious Eric.)

Ariel: Is he - dead?
Scuttle: (Opens Eric's eyelid.) It's hard to say. (Puts his ear against Eric's
  foot.)  Oh, I - I can't make out a heartbeat.
Ariel: No, look! He's breathing. He's so, beautiful.

   What would I give
   To live where you are?
   What would I pay
   To stay here beside you?
   What would I do to see you
   Smiling at me?

   Where would we walk?
   Where would we run?
   If we could stay all day in the sun?
   Just you and me
   And I could be
   Part of your world

  (Sebastion and Flounder have washed up and are watching scene. Max and
  Grimsby approach. Ariel hurries away.)
Grimsby: Eric!  Oh, Eric.  You really delight in these sadistic strains on my
  blood pressure, don't you?
Eric: A girl - rescued me. . . .  She was - singing . . . she had the most -
  beautiful voice.
Grimsby: Ah, Eric, I think you've swallowed a bit too much seawater.  Off we
  go.  Come on, Max.
Sebastian: We just gotta forget this whole thing ever happened.  The sea king
  will never know.  You won't tell him, I won't tell him.  I will stay in one
  piece.
Ariel:
   I don't know when
   I don't know how
   But I know something's starting right now
   Watch and you'll see
   Some day I'll be
   Part of your world

     (Flotsam and Jetsam appear. Fade to Ursula watching from her chamber.)

Ursula: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I can't stand it - it's too easy.  The
  child is in love with a human.  And not just any human - a prince!  Her
  daddy'll LOVE that.  King Triton's headstrong, lovesick girl would make a
  charming addition to my little garden.

     (Fade to palace. Then sister's dressing room.)

Andrina: Ariel, dear, time to come out.  You've been in there all morning.
  (Ariel emerges, singing to herself.)
Atina: What is with her lately?
Ariel: Morning, Daddy.  (Ariel swims off.)
Atina: Oh, she's got it bad.
Triton: What? What has she got?
Andrina: Isn't it obvious, Daddy?  Ariel's in love.
Triton: Ariel?  In love?

     (Cut to Sebastion pacing on rock outside.)

Sebastian: O.K. So far, so good.  I don't think the king knows. But it will not
  be easy keeping something like this a secret for long.
Ariel: (Picking petals off a flower) He loves me . . . hmmm, he loves me
  not. . . .  He loves me!  I knew it!
Sebastian: Ariel, stop talking crazy.
Ariel: I gotta see him again - tonight!  Scuttle knows where he lives.
Sebastian: Ariel - please.  Will you get your head out of the clouds and back
  in the water where it belongs?
Ariel: I'll swim up to his castle.  Then Flounder will splash around to get his
  attention, and then with -
Sebastian: Down HERE is your home! Ariel - listen to me.  The human world -
  it's a mess.  Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there.

   The seaweed is always greener
   In somebody else's lake
   You dream about going up there
   But that is a big mistake
   Just look at the world around you
   Right here on the ocean floor
   Such wonderful things surround you
   What more is you lookin' for?

   Under the sea
   Under the sea
   Darling it's better
   Down where it's wetter
   Take it from me
   Up on the shore they work all day
   Out in the sun they slave away
   While we devotin'
   Full time to floatin'
   Under the sea

   Down here all the fish is happy
   As off through the waves they roll
   The fish on the land ain't happy
   They sad 'cause they in their bowl
   But fish in the bowl is lucky
   They in for a worser fate
   One day when the boss get hungry
   Guess who's gon' be on the plate

   Under the sea
   Under the sea
   Nobody beat us
   Fry us and eat us
   In fricassee
   We what the land folks loves to cook
   Under the sea we off the hook
   We got no troubles
   Life is the bubbles
   Under the sea
   Under the sea
   Since life is sweet here
   We got the beat here
   Naturally
   Even the sturgeon an' the ray
   They get the urge 'n' start to play
   We got the spirit
   You got to hear it
   Under the sea

   The newt play the flute
   The carp play the harp
   The plaice play the bass
   And they soundin' sharp
   The bass play the brass
   The chub play the tub
   The fluke is the duke of soul
   (Yeah)
   The ray he can play
   The lings on the strings
   The trout rockin' out
   The blackfish she sings
   The smelt and the sprat
   They know where it's at
   An' oh that blowfish blow

   Under the sea
   Under the sea
   When the sardine
   Begin the beguine
   It's music to me
   What do they got? A lot of sand
   We got a hot crustacean band
   Each little clam here
   know how to jam here
   Under the sea
   Each little slug here
   Cuttin' a rug here
   Under the sea
   Each little snail here
   Know how to wail here
   That's why it's hotter
   Under the water
   Ya we in luck here
   Down in the muck here
   Under the sea

  (They discover that Ariel has left with Flounder.)
  Ariel? Ariel? Oh . . . somebody's got to nail that girl's fins to the floor.
Seahorse: Sebastian!  Sebastian, I've been looking all over for you.  I've got
  an urgent message from the sea king.
Sebastian: The sea king?
Seahorse: He wants to see you right away - something about Ariel.
Sebastian: He knows!

     (In palace throne room. Triton looking at flower.)

Triton: Let's see, now. . . .  Oh, who could the lucky merman be? (Notices
  Sebastion.) Come in, Sebastion.
Sebastian: (Sotto) I mustn't overreact.  I must remain calm.  (Five octaves
  higher than normal) Yes - (loco) yes, Your Majesty.
Triton: Now, Sebastian, I'm concerned about Ariel.  Have you noticed she's been
  acting peculiar lately?
Sebastian: Peculiar?
Triton: You know, moaning about, daydreaming, singing to herself. . . .  You
  haven't noticed, hmm?
Sebastian: Oh - well, I -
Triton: Sebastian. . . .
Sebastian: Hmmm?
Triton: I know you've been keeping something from me. . . .
Sebastian: Keeping . . . something?
Triton: About Ariel?
Sebastian: Ariel . . . ?
Triton: In love?
Sebastian: I tried to stop her, sir.  She wouldn't listen.  I told her to stay
  away from humans - they are bad, they are trouble, they -
Triton: Humans?  WHAT ABOUT HUMANS?
Sebastian: Humans?  Ho ho ho ho. . . . Who said anything about humans?

     (Fade to Ariel and Flounder entering cave.)

Ariel: Flounder, why can't you just tell me what this is all about?
Flounder: You'll see. It's a suprise.
Ariel: (Sees statue of Eric.) Oh, Flounder- Flounder you're the best! it looks
  just like him.  It even has his eyes.  ""Why, Eric, run away with you?  This
  is all so - so sudden. . . . (Turns around and sees Triton.) Daddy! . . .
Triton: I consider myself a reasonable merman. I set certain rules, and I
  expect those rules to be obeyed.
Ariel: But Daddy!-
Triton: Is it true you rescued a human from drowing?
Ariel: Daddy, I had to-
Triton: Contact between the human world and the mer-world is strictly for-
  bidden. Ariel, you know that! Everyone knows that!
Ariel: He would have died-
Triton: One less human to worry about!
Ariel: You don't even know him.
Triton: Know him? I don't have to know him. They're all the same. Spineless,
  savage, harpooning, fish-eaters, incapable of any feeling-
Ariel: Daddy, I love him!
Triton: No . . . Have you lost your senses completely? He's a human, you're
  a mermaid!
Ariel: I don't care.
Triton: So help me Ariel, I am going to get through to you. And if this is the
  only way, so be it. (Begins to blast the artifacts with his trident.)
Ariel: Daddy!. . . No . . . No, please- Daddy, stop!. . . Daddy, Nooo!!. . .
  (He blasts statue. Ariel begins crying and he leaves, ashamed.)
Sebastion: Ariel, I . . .
Ariel: (Still crying.) Just go away. (He leaves and Flotsan and Jetsam appear.)
Flotsam: Poor child.
Jetsam: Poor, sweet child.
Flotsam: She has a very serious problem
Jetsam: If only there were something we could do.
Flotsam: But there is something.
Ariel: Who - who are you?
Jetsam: Don't be scared.
Flotsam: We represent someone who can help you.
Jetsam: Someone who could make all your dreams come true.
Flotsam and Jetsam: Just imagine -
Jetsam: You and your prince -
Flotsam and Jetsam: Together, forever. . . .
Ariel: I don't understand.
Jetsam: Ursula has great powers
Ariel: The sea witch?  Why, that's - I couldn't possibly - no!  Get out of
 here!  Leave me alone!
Flotsam: Suit yourself.
Jetsam: It was only a suggestion.
  [Jetsam flicks the statue's broken face towards Ariel.]
Ariel: [Looking at the face] Wait.
Flotsam and Jetsam: Yeeeeeeeeeess?

     (Cut to outside of cave with Flounder and Sebastion.)

Flounder: (snif) Poor Ariel.
Sebastion: I didn't mean to tell, it was an accident. (Ariel passes by.)
  Ariel - where are you going?  Ariel, what are you doing here with this
  riff-raff?
riel: I'm going to see Ursula.
Sebastian: Ariel, no!  No, she's a demon, she's a monster!
Ariel: Why don't you go tell my father?  You're good at that.
Sebastion: But . . . But, I . . . (To Flounder.) Come on. (They travel towards
  Ursula's cavern.)
Flotsam and Jetsam: This way. (Ariel enters and is hung up in the garden of
  souls.)
Ursula: Come in.  Come in, my child.  We mustn't lurk in doorways - it's rude.
  One MIGHT question your upbringing. . . . Now, then.  You're here because
  you have a thing for this human.  This, er, prince fellow.  Not that I blame
  you - he is quite a catch, isn't he?  Well, angel fish, the solution to your
  problem is simple.  The only way to get what you want - is to become a human
  yourself.
Ariel: Can you DO that?
Ursula: My dear, sweet child. That's what I do - it's what I live for. To help
  unfortunate merfolk - like yourself. Poor souls with no one else to turn to.

   I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
   They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
   But you'll find that nowadays
   I've mended all my ways
   Repented, seen the light and made a switch
   True? Yes

   And I fortunately know a little magic
   It's a talent that I always have possessed
   And here lately, please don't laugh
   I use it on behalf
   Of the miserable, lonely and depressed
   (Pathetic)

   Poor unfortunate souls
   In pain
   In need
   This one longing to be thinner
   That one wants to get the girl
   And do I help them?
   Yes, indeed
   Those poor unfortunate souls
   So sad
   So true
   They come flocking to my cauldron
   Crying, ""Spells, Ursula please!""
   And I help them?
   Yes, I do

   Now it's happened once or twice
   Someone couldn't pay the price
   And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
   Yes, I've had the odd complaint
   But on the whole I've been a saint
   To those poor unfortunate souls

  Now, here's the deal.  I will make you a potion that will turn you into
  a human for three days.  Got that?  Three days.  Now listen, this is import-
  ant.  Before the sun sets on the third day, you've got to get dear ol'
  princey to fall in love with you.  That is, he's got to kiss you.  Not just
  any kiss - the kiss of true love.  If he does kiss you before the sun sets on
  the third day, you'll remain human, permanently, but - if he doesn't, you
  turn back into a mermaid, and - you belong to me.
Sebastion: No Ariel! (He is silenced by Flotsam and Jetsam.)
Ursula: Have we got a deal?
Ariel: If I become human, I'll never be with my father or sisters again.
Ursula: That's right. . . .  But - you'll have your man.  Life's full of tough
  choices, innit? Oh - and there is one more thing. We haven't discussed the
  subject of payment.  You can't get something for nothing, you know.
Ariel: But I don't have any -
Ursula: I'm not asking much. Just a token, really, a trifle.  You'll never even
  miss it.  What I want from you is . . . your voice.
Ariel: My voice?
Ursula: You've got it, sweetcakes.  No more talking, singing, zip.
Ariel: But without my voice, how can I -
Ursula: You'll have your looks! Your pretty face! And don't underestimate the
  importance of body language! Ha!

   The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
   They think a girl who gossips is a bore
   Yes, on land it's much preferred
   For ladies not to say a word
   And after all, dear, what is idle prattle for?

   Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
   True gentlemen avoid it when they can
   But they dote and swoon and fawn
   On a lady who's withdrawn
   It's she who holds her tongue who gets her man

   Come on, you poor unfortunate soul
   Go ahead!
   Make your choice!
   I'm a very busy woman
   And I haven't got all day
   It won't cost much
   Just your voice!
   You poor unfortunate soul
   It's sad
   But true
   If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet
   You've got to pay the toll
   Take a gulp and take a breath
   And go ahead and sign the scroll!
   Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys
   The boss is on a roll
   This poor unfortunate soul.

  (Ariel signs contract.)
   Paluga, sarruga, come winds of the Caspian Sea.
   Now rings us glossitis and max laryngitis,
   La voce to me!
  Now . . . sing!
Ariel: (Sings.)
Ursula: Keep singing! (Giant magical hands rip out Ariel's voice and give it to
  Ursula. She laughs as Ariel is changed into a human and rushed to the surf-
  ace by Flounder and Sebastion.)

     (Fade to beach. Eric and Max are walking near castle.)

Eric: (Playing flute.) That voice. I can't get it out of my head. I've looked
  everywhere, Max - where could she be? (On other side of rocks Ariel is
  washed up. Sebastion and Flounder are exausted. Ariel sees her legs and is
  amazed.)
Scuttle: Well, look at what the catfish dragged in!  Look at ya!  Look at ya!
  There's something different.  Don't tell me - I got it.  It's your hairdo,
  right?  You've been using the dinglehopper, right?  No?  No huh, well let me
  see.  New . . . seashells?  No new seashells.  I gotta admit I can't put my
  foot on it right now, but if I just stand here long enough I know that I'll -
Sebastian: SHE'S GOT LEGS, YOU IDIOT!  She traded her voice to the sea witch
  and got legs.  Jeez, man . . .
Scuttle: I knew that.
Flounder: Ariel's been turned into a human. She's gotta make the prince fall in
  love with her, and he's gotta ki- he's gotta kiss her. (Ariel tries to get
  up.)
Sebastion: And she's only got three days. Just look at her. On legs. On human
  legs! My nerves are shot. This is a catastrophe!  What would her father say?
  I'll tell you what her father'd say, he'd say he's gonna kill himself a crab,
  that's what her father'd say! I'm gonna march meself straight home right now
  and tell him just like I shoulda done de minute- (Ariel grabs him.) . . . and
  don't you shake your head at me, young lady.  Maybe there's still time. If
  we could get that witch to give you back your voice, you could go home with
  all the normal fish, and just be . . . just be . . . just be miserable for
  the rest of your life.  All right, all right.  I'll try to help you find that
  prince.  Boy.  What a soft-shell I'm turning out to be.
Scuttle: Now, Ariel, I'm tellin' ya, if you wanna be a human the first thing
  you gotta do is dress like one. Now lemme see.

     (Cut to Eric and Max. Max smells Ariel and gets excited.)

Eric: Max? Huh . . . what, Max!
Scuttle: (Whistles.) Ya look great kid. Ya look - sensational. (They hear Max.
  He arrives and chases Ariel up on a rock.)
Eric: Max . . . Max - Quiet Max! What's gotten into you fella? (Sees Ariel.)
  Oh . . . Oh, I see. Are you O.K., miss?  I'm sorry if this knucklehead
  scared you.  He's harmless, really - . . . you . . . seem very familiar . . .
  to me.  Have we met?  We have met?  I knew it!  You're the one - the one I've
  been looking for!  What's your name? (Ariel mouths ""Ariel"" but no words come
  out.) What's wrong?  What is it?  You can't speak? (Ariel shakes her head.)
  Oh.  Then you couldn't be who I thought. (Ariel and Max look frustrated. She
  tries pantomime.) What is it?  You're hurt?  No, No . . . You need help.
  (She falls into him.) Whoa, whoa, careful - careful - easy. Gee, you must
  have really been through something. Don't worry, I'll help you. Come on . . .
  Come on, you'll be okay.

     (Fade to Ariel in bath playing with bubbles.)

Carlotta: Washed up from a shipwreck.  Oh, the poor thing.  We'll have you
  feeling better in no time.  [Picks up Ariel's ""dress""] I'll just - I'll just
  get this washed for you.

     (Cut to Sebastion in dress getting washed.)
Woman 1: Well you must have at least heard about this girl.
Woman 2: Well, Gretchen says . . . (Sebastion is dunked.) . . . since when has
  Gretchen got anything right. I mean really, this girl shows up in rags and
  doesn't speak-
Sebastion: Madame, please ! . . .
Woman 2: . . . not my idea of a princess. If Eric's looking for a girl, I know
  a couple of highly available ones right here . . . (Sebastion dives into
  kitchen and sees various fish cooking. He faints.)

     (Cut to castle dining room.)

Grimsby: Oh, Eric, be reasonable.  Nice young ladies just don't - swim around
  rescuing people in the middle of the ocean and then - flutter off into
  oblivion, like some -
Eric: I'm tellin' you, Grim, she was REAL!  I'm gonna find that girl - and I'm
  gonna marry her.
Carlotta: Ha Ha. Come on honey. Don't be shy. (Ariel enteres in a beautiful
  dress.)
Grimsby: Oh, Eric, isn't she a vision?
Eric: You look - wonderful.
Grimsby: Come come come, you must be famished. Let me help you my dear. There
  we go - ah - quite comfy? Uh. It's - It's not ofen that we have such a lovely
  dinner guest, eh Eric? (Ariel starts combing hair with a fork. They look
  dumbfounded and she is embarrased. She sees pipe and brightens.) Uh, do you
  like it? It is rather - fine . . . (She blows its contents into his face.
  Eric laughs.)
Carlotta: Oh, my!
Eric: Ahem, so sorry Grim.
Carlotta: Why, Eric, that's the first time I've seen you smile in weeks.
Grimsby: (Wiping his face.) Oh, very amusing. Carlotta, my dear, what's for
  dinner?
Carlotta: Oooh, you're gonna love it.  Chef's been fixing his specialty,
  stuffed crab.

     (Cut to Sebastion watching Louis cook. He is humming to himself.)

Louis:
   Les poissons
   Les poissons
   How I love les poissons
   Love to chop
   And to serve little fish
   First I cut off their heads
   Then I pull out the bones
   Ah mais oui
   Ca c'est toujours delish
   Les poissons
   Les poissons
   Hee hee hee
   Hah hah hah
   With the cleaver I hack them in two
   I pull out what's inside
   And I serve it up fried
   God, I love little fishes
   Don't you?

All right, ladies and gents,



Comical poems suitable for the occasion, extemporized and thought up before your very eyes.
All right, here we go.



	Room here for everyone gather around



	The constable's ""responstable."" Now, how does that sound?



	Hello, Miss Lark I got one for you.



	Miss Lark likes to walk in the park with Andrew.



Hello, Andrew.



	Ah, Mrs. Cory a story for you.



	Your daughters were shorter than you, but they grew.



	Dear Miss Persimmon--






Miss Persimmon:



Yes?






Bert:



	Wind's in the east, mist comin' in.



	Like something is brewin' about to begin



	Can't put me finger on what lies in store



	But I feel what's to happen, all happened before.



I'm sorry. Where was I? Thank you, one and all, for your kind support. Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.
Crikey. Bless you, guv. Generosity itself, that's what you are. No charge.



Oh, it's you! Hello. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say? All right. Come along with me. This
here's Cherry Tree Lane. Nice little spot, you might say. Number 17's just down a bit. Now, this
imposing edifice what first greets the eye, is the home of Admiral Boom, late of His Majesty's
Navy. Likes his house shipshape, he does, shipshape and Bristol fashion at all times.






Admiral Boom:



Time gun ready?






Mr Binnacle:



Ready and charged, sir.






Admiral Boom:



Three minutes and six seconds.






Mr Binnacle:



Aye, aye, sir.






Bert:



What he's famous for is punctuality. The whole world takes its time from Greenwich. But
Greenwich, they say, takes its time from Admiral Boom. What cheer, admiral?






Admiral Boom:



Good afternoon to you, young man. Where are you bound?






Bert:



Number 17. Got some parties here in tow what wants to see it.






Admiral Boom:



Enter that in the log.






Mr Binnacle:



Aye, aye, sir.






Admiral Boom:



A word of advice, young man: storm signals are up at number 17. Bit of heavy weather brewing
there.






Bert:



Thank you, sir. Keep an eye skinned. Here we are. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane. Residence
of George Banks, Esquire. Hello, hello, hello. The admiral's right. Heavy weather brewin' at
number 17, and no mistake.






Mrs. Brill:



Leave her alone!






Ellen:



Shut up!






Mrs. Brill:



I'll show you. Don't you be trying to stop the wretched creature! Let her go, that's what I say, and
good riddance! I never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door.






Ellen:



But who gets stuck with the children with no nanny in the house? Me, that's who!






Mrs. Brill:



Her and her high and mighty ways! And that face of her that would stop a coal barge, it would.






Katie Nanna:



Indeed, Mrs. Brill! I wouldn't stay in this house another minute, not if you heap me with all the
jewels in Christendom.






Ellen:



No, no, Katie Nanna, don't go!






Katie Nanna:



Stand away from that door, my girl!






Ellen:



But what am I gonna tell the master about the children?






Katie Nanna:



It's no concern of mine. Those little beasts have run away from me for the last time.






Ellen:



They must be somewhere. Did you look around the zoo in the park? You know how Jane and
Michael is. Coo! You don't think the lion could've got at them, do ya? You know how fond they
was of hangin' around the cage.






Katie Nanna:



I said my say, and that's all I'll say. I've done with this house forever.






Mrs. Brill:



Well, hip, hip, hooray! And don't stumble on the way out, dearie.






Ellen:



Now, now, Katie Nanna!



Mrs. Banks! She's home!






Mrs. Banks:



	Our daughter's daughters will adore us



	And we'll sing in grateful chorus



	""Well done, Sister Suffragette""



Good evening, Katie Nanna, Ellen. We had the most glorious meeting! Mrs. Whitbourne-Allen
chained herself to the wheel of the prime minister's carriage. You should've been there.






Katie Nanna:



Mrs. Banks, I would like a word with you.






Mrs. Banks:



And Mrs. Ainslie, she was carried off to prison, singing and scattering pamphlets all the way!






Katie Nanna:



I'm glad you're home, madam. I've always given the best that's in me.






Mrs. Banks:



On, thank you, Katie Nanna. I always knew you were one of us.



	We're clearly soldiers in petticoats



	And dauntless crusaders for women's votes



	Though we adore men individually



	We agree that as a group they're rather stupid






Katie nanna:



Mrs. Banks.






Mrs. Banks:



	Cast off the shackles of yesterday



	Shoulder to shoulder into the fray



	Our daughter's daughters will adore us



	And they'll sing in grateful chorus



	""Well done, Sister Suffragette""






Katie Nanna:



Being that as it may, I do not wish to offend, but I--






Mrs. Banks:



	From Kensington to Billingsgate



	One hears the restless cries



	From every corner of the land: womankind arise



	Political equality and equal rights with men



	Take heart for Mrs. Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again



	No more the meek and mild subservients we



	We're fighting for our rights, militantly - never you fear






Katie Nanna:



If I may have a word, Mrs. Banks.






Mrs. Banks:



	So cast off the shackles of yesterday



	



Katie Nanna:



Mrs. Banks!






Mrs. Banks:



	And shoulder to shoulder into the fray



	Our daughter's daughters will adore us



	And they'll sing in grateful chorus - ""well done""






Katie Nanna:



Mrs. Banks.






Mrs. Banks:



	""Well done""






Katie Nanna:



Mrs. Banks.






Mrs. Banks:



	""Well done, Sister Suf--""






Katie Nanna:



Mrs. Banks!






Mrs. Banks:



What is it, Katie Nanna?






Katie Nanna:



Mrs. Banks, I have something to say to you.






Mrs. Banks:



Where are the children?






Katie Nanna:



The children, madam, to be precise, are not here. They've disappeared again.






Mrs. Banks:



Katie Nanna, this is really too careless of you. Doesn't it make the third time this week?






Katie Nanna:



The fourth, madam. And I for one have had my fill of it. I'm not one to speak ill of the children,
but--






Mrs. Banks:



Oh, please, when do you expect them home?






Katie Nanna:



I really couldn't say. And now if you'd be good enough to compute my wages, I'll--






Mrs. Banks:



Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna! You're not leaving? What will Mr. Banks say? He's going to be cross
enough as it is to come home and find the children missing. Ellen, put these things away. You
know how the cause infuriates Mr. Banks.






Ellen:



Yes, ma'am.






Mrs. Banks:



Katie Nanna, I beseech you. Please reconsider. Think of the children. Think of Mr. Banks. He
was just beginning to get used to you.






Admiral Boom:



Posts, everyone! Four, three, two, one. Fire!






Mrs. Banks:



Katie Nanna, I do beseech you--






Katie Nanna:



My wages, if you please.






Mr. Banks:



Bit early tonight, aren't you, admiral?






Admiral Boom:



Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual. How are things in the world of finance?






Mr. Banks:



Never better. Money's sound. Credit rates are moving up, up, up. And the British pound is the
admiration of the world.






Admiral Boom:



Good man.






Mr. Banks:



How do things look from where you stand?






Admiral Boom:



Bit chancy, I'd say. The wind's coming up and the glass is falling. - don't like the look of it.






Mr. Banks:



Good, good, good.






Admiral Boom:



Banks, shouldn't wonder if you weren't steering into a nasty piece of weather. Banks! Do you
hear me?






Mr. Banks:



Hello, Katie Nanna. That must be heavy. Allow me.






Katie Nanna:



Hmph!






Mr. Banks:



What a very pretty hat.



	I feel a surge of deep satisfaction



	Much as a king astride his noble steed - thank you.



	When I return from daily strife, to hearth and wife



	How pleasant is the life I lead






Mrs. Banks:



Dear, it's about the children.






Mr. Banks:



Yes, yes, yes.



	I run my home precisely on schedule



	At 6:01 I march through my door



	My slippers, sherry and pipe are due at 6:02



	Consistent is the life I lead






Mrs. Banks:



George, they're missing.






Mr. Banks:



Splendid. Splendid.



	It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910



	King Edward's on the throne it's the age of men



	I'm the lord of my castle the sovereign, the liege



	I treat my subjects, servants children, wife with a firm but gentle hand, noblesse oblige



	It's 6:03 and the heirs to my dominion



	Are scrubbed and tubbed and adequately fed



	And so I'll pat them on the head and send them off to bed



	Ah, lordly is the life I lead



Winifred, where are the children?






Mrs. Banks:



They're not here, dear.






Mr. Banks:



What? Well, of course they're here! Where else would they be?






Mrs. Banks:



I don't know, George






Mr. Banks:



You don't know?






Mrs. Banks:



Well, they're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.






Mr. Banks:



Very well. I'll deal with this at once.



Give me the police station, quickly, please.






Mrs. Banks:



I don't think we need bother the police, dear. The facts of the matter--






Mr. Banks:



Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts. One fact, and one fact alone is crystal clear!
Katie Nanna's faltered at her post. She's let the family down. And I shall bring her to boo-- oh.
She's left us, hasn't she?






Mrs. Banks:



Yes, dear, only just.






Mr. Banks:



What, uh-- yes. George Banks here. Yes. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. It's a matter of some urgency.
I should like you to send a policeman around immediately.






Mrs. Banks:



The policeman's here, George!






Mr. Banks:



What? Oh, how very prompt. What wonderful service. Thank you so much. Good night. Come
in, constable. Come in.






Constable:



Thank you, sir. While going about my duties on the other side of the park, I noted some
valuables that had gone astray. I believe they're yours, sir.






Mr. Banks:



Valuables?






Constable:



Come along, now. Come along.






Mrs. Banks:



Jane! Michael!






Mr. Banks:



Winifred, please don't be emotional.






Constable:



Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir. They've had a long, weary walk today.






Mr. Banks:



Children, come here at once. Well?






Jane:



I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father. You see, it was windy. And the kite was too strong for us.






Constable:



In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the kite that ran away, not the children.






Mr. Banks:



Thank you, Constable. I think I can manage this.






Jane:



Actually it wasn't a very good kite. We made it ourselves. Perhaps if you helped us to make
one--






Constable:



Ah, that's the ticket, sir. Kites are skittish things. Why, only last week with me own youngsters--






Mr. Banks:



I'm very grateful to you, Constable, for returning the children. And I'm sure that if you go to the
kitchen, Cook'll find you a plate of something.






Constable:



Thank you, sir. I shall now return to my duties.






Jane:



Thank you, Constable.






Constable:



Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am. Good night, sir. Cook'll find me something. I never--






Mrs. Banks:



I'm awfully sorry about this, George. I'll expect you'll want to discuss it.






Mr. Banks:



I would indeed! Ellen, take Jane and Michael upstairs straightaway.






Ellen:



Yes, sir. I knew it. When all's said and done, who bears the brunt of everything around here?
Me, that's who! They don't want an honest, hard-workin' girl around here. They need a ruddy
zookeeper.






Mrs. Banks:



I'm sorry, dear, but when I chose Katie Nanna, I thought she would be firm with the children. She
looked so solemn and cross.






Mr. Banks:



Winifred, never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint.






Mrs. Banks:



I'll try to do better next time.






Mr. Banks:



Next time? My dear, you've engaged six nannies in the last four months! And they've all been
unqualified disasters.






Mrs. Banks:



I quite agree.






Mr. Banks:



Choosing a nanny for the children is an important and delicate task. It requires insight, balanced
judgment, and an ability to read character. Under the circumstances, I think it might be apropos
to take it upon myself to, uh, select the next person.






Mrs. Banks:



Oh, would you, George?






Mr. Banks:



Obviously the way to find a proper nanny, is to go about it in a proper fashion. I shall put an
advertisement in The Times. Take this down please.






Mrs. Banks:



Yes, of course, dear.






Mr. Banks:



Wanted. Uh, no. Uh, required. Nanny: firm, respectable, no nonsense.



	A British nanny must be a general



	The future empire lies within her hands



	And so the person that we need



	To mold the breed



	Is a nanny who can give commands



You getting this, Winifred?






Mrs. Banks:



Oh, yes, dear. Every word.



	A British bank is run with precision



	A British home requires nothing less



	Tradition, discipline and rules must be the tools



	Without them, disorder, catastrophe, anarchy



	In short you have a ghastly mess






Mrs. Banks:



Splendid, George! Inspirational. The Times will be so pleased.






Jane:



Father?






Mr. Banks:



Yes?






Jane:



We've discussed everything, and we're very sorry about what we did today.






Mr. Banks:



I should certainly think so.






Jane:



It was wrong to run away from Katie Nanna.






Mr. Banks:



It was indeed.






Jane:



And we do so want to get on with the new nanny.






Mr. Banks:



Very sensible. I shall be glad to have your help in the matter.






Jane:



We thought you would. That's why we wrote this advertisement.






Mr. Banks:



Advertisement for what?






Jane:



For the new nanny.






Mr. Banks:



You wrote an advert--






Mrs. Banks:



George, I think we should listen.






Jane:



You said you wanted our help.






Mr. Banks:



But, I-- oh, very well.






Jane:



""Wanted: a nanny for two adorable children.""






Mr. Banks:



""Adorable."" well, that's debatable, I must say.






Jane:



	If you want this choice position



	Have a cheery disposition






Mr. Banks:



Jane, I don't--






Jane:



	Rosy cheeks, no warts






Michael:



That's the part I put in.






Jane:



	Play games, all sorts



	You must be kind you must be witty



	Very sweet and fairly pretty






Mr. Banks:



Well, of all the ridic-






Mrs. Banks:



George, please!






Jane:



	Take us on outings give us treats



	Sing songs bring sweets



	Never be cross or cruel never give us castor oil or gruel



	Love us as a son and daughter



	And never smell of barley water






Michael:



I put that in, too.






Jane:



	If you won't scold and dominate us



	We will never you give you cause to hate us



	We won't hide your spectacles so you can't see



	Put toads in your bed or pepper in your tea



	Hurry, nanny



	Many thanks



	Sincerely






Jane & Michael:



	Jane and Michael Banks






Mr. Banks:



Thank you. Most interesting. And now I think we've had quite enough of this nonsense. Please
return to the nursery.






Mrs. Banks:



They were only trying to help. They're just children.






Mr. Banks:



I'm well aware they're just children, Winifred. I only congratulate myself that I decided to step in
and take a hand. ""Play games, sing songs, give treats."" Ridiculous. There's no question in my
mind whatsoever. Now is the time for action.



Give me The Times, please. No, I do not know the number.






Mrs. Banks:



Oh, George, you're always so forceful.






Mrs. Banks:



The Times? George Banks here. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. I wish to place an advertisement in your
column.






Admiral Boom:



Time gun ready?






Mr. Binnacle:



Ready and charged, sir.






Admiral Boom:



I'll take the report, Mr. Binnacle.






Mr. Binnacle:



The wind has changed, Sir. Seems to be comin' in from a new quarter.






Admiral Boom:



So it is.






Mr. Binnacle:



Sir?






Admiral Boom:



What is it?






Mr. Binnacle:



Bit of somethin' or other taking place off the port bow.






Admiral Boom:



Ghastly looking crew, I must say!






Ellen:



Coo! There's a fair queue of nannies outside, sir. Shall I show 'em in?






Mr. Banks:



Ellen, I said 8:00, and 8:00 it shall jolly well be. You see? Twelve seconds to go. Ten, nine,
eight---






Mrs. Banks:



Posts! Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!






Mr. Banks:



Ellen, it is now 8:00.






Ellen:



Yes, sir.






Mr. Banks:



But I have told you time and time again, Ellen, I dislike being hurried into things.






Jane:



I don't understand. They're not what we advertised for at all.



Michael, look!






Michael:



Perhaps it's a witch.






Jane:



Of course not. Witches have brooms.



It's her. It's the person. She's answered our advertisement.






Michael:



Rosy cheeks and everything.






Mr. Banks:



Ellen, you may now show them in, one at a time.






Ellen:



Yes, sir. You may come in one at a time.






Mary Poppins:



Thank you.






Ellen:



Oh.






Mary Poppins:



You are the father of Jane and Michael Banks, are you not? I said, you are the father of Jane
and Michael Banks.






Mr. Banks:



Well, well ye-- yes, of course, I mean. Uh-- you brought your references, I presume. May I see
them?






Mary Poppins:



Oh, I make it a point never to give references. A very old-fashioned idea to my mind.






Mr. Banks:



Is that so? We'll have to see about that then, won't we?






Mary Poppins:



Now then, the qualifications. ""Item one: a cheery disposition."" I am never cross. ""Item two: rosy
cheeks."" Obviously. ""Item three: play games, all sorts."" Well, I'm sure the children will find my
games extremely diverting.






Mr. Banks:



May I? Eh, this paper? Where did you get it from? I thought I tore it up.






Mary Poppins:



Excuse me. ""Item four: you must be kind."" I am kind, but extremely firm. Have you lost
something?






Mr. Banks:



Ah! Yeah. That paper, you see. I thought that I--






Mary Poppins:



You are George Banks, are you not?






Mr. Banks:



What?






Mary Poppins:



And you did advertise for a nanny, did you not?






Mr. Banks:



George Banks.






Mary Poppins:



Very well then.






Mr. Banks:



I tore it up, turned it over. Tore it up again and threw it in there. Yes.






Mary Poppins:



I beg your pardon. Are you ill?






Mr. Banks:



I hope not.






Mary Poppins:



Now, about my wages. The reference here is very obscure.






Mr. Banks:



Very obscure.






Mary Poppins:



We must be very clear on that point, mustn't we?






Mr. Banks:



Yes, we must indeed.






Mary Poppins:



I shall require every second Tuesday off.






Mr. Banks:



Every Tuesday.






Mary Poppins:



On second thoughts, I believe a trial period would be wise. Hmm. I'll give you one week. I'll know
by then. I'll see the children now. Thank you.






Close your mouth please, Michael. We are not a codfish. Well, don't stand there staring. Best
foot forward. Spit spot!






Mrs. Banks:



George? Aah! George, what on earth are you doing? I thought you were interviewing nannies.






Mr. Banks:



I was! I was!






Mrs. Banks:



You mean you've selected one already?






Mr. Banks:



Yes, it's done. It's, it's all done.






Mrs. Banks:



Well, where is she?






Mr. Banks:



What? Well, eh, she's in the nursery of course, I mean. I put her to work straightaway, I mean.






Mrs. Banks:



How clever of you! I would have muddled the whole thing. Tell me, is she everything that we'd
hoped she be?






Mr. Banks:



Well, I - it all happened rather quickly. I mean, I-- I, uh--






Mrs. Banks:



Will she be firm? Will she give commands? Will she mold our young breed?






Mr. Banks:



You know, Winifred, I think she will. I think she will.






Mrs. Banks:



In that case, perhaps you'd better tell Ellen to dismiss the others.






Mr. Banks:



The others? Oh, yes. Ellen?






Ellen:



Y-yes, sir?






Mr. Banks:



Tell the other applicants they may go. The position has been filled.






Ellen:



The others, sir?






Mr. Banks:



Yes, the others. How many n-nannies does she think we need in this house?






Ellen:



The position has been filled.






Jane:



I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.






Mary Poppins:



It is rather like a bear pit, isn't it?






Michael:



That's a funny sort of bag.






Mary Poppins:



Carpet.






Michael:



You mean to carry carpets in?






Mary Poppins:



No. Made of.






Jane:



This is your room, and there's a lovely view of the park.






Mary Poppins:



Hmm. Well, it's not exactly Buckingham Palace. Still, it's clean. Yes, I think it will be quite
suitable. Just needs a touch here and there. Well, first things first. I always say, the place to
hang a hat is on a hat stand. Ah! This will never do! I much prefer seeing all of my face at the
same time.






Michael:



There-- but there was nothing in it.






Mary Poppins:



Never judge things by their appearance. Even carpetbags. I'm sure I never do. A thing of beauty
is a joy forever. Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.






Michael:



We better keep an eye on this one. She's tricky.






Jane:



She's wonderful.






Mary Poppins:



Much better! Now, let me see. That's funny. I always carry it with me. It must be here
somewhere.






Michael:



What?






Mary Poppins:



My tape measure.






Michael:



What do you want it for?






Mary Poppins:



I want to see how you two measure up. Well, that's the funniest thing I ever saw. I know it's
down here somewhere. Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha! Here it is. Good. Come along, then. Quickly. Head up,
Michael. Don't slouch. Just as I thought. Extremely stubborn and suspicious.






Michael:



I am not!






Mary Poppins:



See for yourself.






Michael:



""Extremely stubborn and sus--""






Mary Poppins:



Suspicious.



Now you, Jane. Mmm. ""Rather inclined to giggle. Doesn't put things away.""






Michael:



How 'bout you?






Mary Poppins:



Very well. Hold this for me. As I expected. ""Mary Poppins. Practically perfect in every way.""






Jane:



Mary Poppins! Is that your name? It's lovely.






Mary Poppins:



Thank you. I've always liked it. Now, shall we get on with it?






Jane:



Get on with what?






Mary Poppins:



In your advertisement, did you not specifically request to play games?






Jane:



Oh, yes!






Mary Poppins:



Very well, then. Our first game is called ""well begun is half done.""






Michael:



I don't like the sound of that.






Mary Poppins:



Otherwise entitled, ""let's tidy up the nursery.""






Michael:



I told you she was tricky.






Mary Poppins:



Shall we begin?






Jane:



It is a game, isn't it, Mary Poppins?






Mary Poppins:



Well, it depends on your point of view. You see,



	In every job that must be done,



	There is an element of fun.



	You find the fun, and snap!



	The job's a game.



	And every task you undertake



	Becomes a piece of cake



	A lark, a spree it's very clear to see



	That a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down



	The medicine go down



	Medicine go down



	Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down



	In a most delightful way



	A robin feathering his nest



	Has very little time to rest



	While gathering his bits of twine and twig



	Though quite intent in his pursuit,



	He has a merry tune to toot



	He knows a song will move the job along



	For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down



	The medicine go down



	Medicine go down



	Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down



	In a most delightful way



	The honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb



	Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro



	Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip



	And hence






Reflection:



	And hence






Mary Poppins:



	They find






Reflection:



	They find






Mary Poppins & Reflection:



	Their task is not a grind



Mary Poppins:



Cheeky.



Don't be all day about it, please.






Michael:



Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!






Mary Poppins:



Well, that was very--



Thank you now-- when you've quite finished!



Thank you. That will be quite sufficient. Hats and coats, please. It's time for our outing in the
park.






Michael:



I don't want an outing. I want to tidy up the nursery again.






Mary Poppins:



Enough is as good as a feast. Come along, please. Let me look at you. Well, you're not as well
turned out as I'd like. Still, there's time. There's time. Spit spot! And off we go.






Jane & Michael:



	For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down



	The medicine go down



	Medicine go down



	Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine



	Go down in the most delightful way






Bert:



	Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo



	I does what I likes and I likes what I do



Hello, art lovers.



	Today I'm a screever and as you can see



	A screever's an artist of highest degree



	And it's all me own work



	From me own memory



Well, not Royal Academy, I suppose. Still they're better than a finger in your eye, ain't they?



	Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo



	I draws what I likes and I likes what I drew



	No remuneration do I ask of you



	But me cap would be glad of a copper or two



	Me cap would be glad of a copper or two



Wait! Don't move. Don't move a muscle. Stay right where you are. I'd know that silhouette
anywhere! Mary Poppins!






Mary Poppins:



It's nice to see you again, Bert. I expect you know Jane and Michael.






Bert:



Well, I've seen 'em here and about. Chasin' a kite last time, weren't it?






Jane:



Mary Poppins is taking us to the park.






Bert:



To the park? Not if I know Mary Poppins. Other nannies take children to the park. When you're
with Mary Poppins, suddenly you're in places you've never dreamed of. And quick as you can
say ""Bob's your uncle,"" the most unusual things begin to happen.






Mary Poppins:



I'm sure I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.






Bert:



Well mind, it's not my place to say, but what she's probably got in mind, is a jolly holiday
somewheres or other. Something along these lines, I shouldn't be surprised. ""Punting on the
Thames."" That's always good if you like an outing. Here we go.



The circus. How about a lovely circus? Lions and tigers. World-famous artistes performing
death-defyin' feats, of dexterity and skill before your very eyes. Ta-da! Ta-da!






Jane:



Oh, that's lovely. If you please, I'd much rather go there.






Bert:



Beautiful, ain't it? A typical English countryside, as done by a true and lovin' hand. Though you
can't see it, there's a little country fair down that road and uh, over the hill.






Michael:



I don't see any road.






Bert:



What? No road? Just wants a bit of somethin' here, and a bit of somethin' there. There. A
country road suitable for travel and high adventure.






Jane:



Please may we go, Mary Poppins? Please? Such a lovely place. Don't you think it's lovely, Mary
Poppins?






Bert:



Now's the time, Mary Poppins. No one's lookin'.






Jane & Michael:



Please, Mary Poppins. Please! Please, Mary Poppins. Please!






Mary Poppins:



I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself, thank you.






Bert:



All right, I'll do it myself.






Mary Poppins:



Do what?






Bert:



Bit of magic.






Michael:



A bit of magic?






Bert:



It's easy. Let's see. You think. You wink. You do a double blink. You close your eyes and jump.






Jane:



Is something 'sposed to happen?






Mary Poppins:



Bert, what utter nonsense! Ohh! Why do you always complicate things that are really quite
simple? Give my your hand, please, Michael. Don't slouch. One, two.






Bert:



Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.






Mary Poppins:



Do you really think so?






Bert:



Cross my heart you do. Like the day I met ya.






Mary Poppins:



You look fine, too, Bert.






Michael:



I thought you said there was a fair.






Bert:



So I did. Down the road behind the hill, remember?






Jane:



Come on! I hear the merry-go-round.






Bert:



Tell 'em Bert sent ya.






Mary Poppins:



Don't fall and smudge the drawing.






Bert:



	Ain't it a glorious day



	Right as a mornin' in May



	I feel like I could fly






Mary Poppins:



Now, Bert. None of your larking about.






Bert:



	Have you ever seen



	The grass so green



	Or a bluer sky

Very nice. Very nice, indeed, if you don't wanna go nowhere.






Mary Poppins:



Who says we're not going anywhere? Oh, guard!






Guard:



Righto, Mary Poppins.






Mary Poppins:



Thank you.






Guard:



They're off! It's Mary Poppins leadin' by two lengths. Jane is second by a length. Michael third.






Michael:

Bert:



Do you hear that, mate? Do you wanna put up with that? That's the ticket! Come on, my lad. Is
that the best you can do?






Michael:



Hurry up, boy. Hurry up!

Not so fast, please. Michael! Now really, Bert. You're as bad as the children.

      NEWSPAPER HEADLINE MONTAGE:
      
      HEADLINES flash before us, displaying their accompanying
      photographs.
      
      ""UBERMAN - METRO CITY'S HERO AFTER DEFEATING MASTER MIND!
      
      PHOTO: A chiseled, statuesque man wearing the COOLEST SUPER
      HERO SUIT IMAGINABLE, COMPLETE WITH FLOWING CAPE, shines a
      confident smile at the lens. This is UBERMAN, champion of
      METRO CITY.
      
      ""UBERMAN DEFEATS MASTER MIND'S GIANT ROBOT!""
      
      PHOTO: Wide-shot of Uberman in mid-flight lifting the GIANT
      ROBOT in the sky above the city buildings.
      
      ""MASTER MIND ALL WET AFTER UBERMAN FOILS AQUARIUM HEIST!""
      
      PHOTO: Uberman stands knee-deep in water. He has his enemy by
      the collar. The villain blocks his face from the shot with a
      METALLIC GAUNTLET.
      
      The images start to flash by even quicker, each showing the
      MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN in various stages of humiliation. In each
      photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored
      glove.
      
      We ZOOM IN to the last headline.
      
      ""MASTER MIND BEHIND BARS ONCE AGAIN - THANKS TO UBERMAN!""
      
      PHOTO: Uberman stands in a gallant pose with his fists on his
      hips, obviously trying to accentuate the ""U"" insignia on his
      chest.
      
      END OF CREDITS SEQUENCE
      
      EXT. BUILDING - DAY
      
      We DISSOLVE from the photograph to Uberman standing in the
      exact same position.
      
      WE PULL BACK showing him atop a BUILDING overlooking the city
      below. A perfect view for our guardian hero.
      
      He watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as
      people happily go about their day.
      
      Yet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman's
      expression.
                                                               2.
      
      
      
                          UBERMAN
                You look so peaceful from up here.
      
      His serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud BEEPING SOUND
      coming from his wrist.
      
      He looks down at a BRACELET (a manly one) on his right arm.
      It's a silver band with a FLASHING red letter ""U"".
      
                          UBERMAN (CONT'D)
                Looks like Roxanne's in trouble
                again.
      
      Uberman leaps off the building and into the air. His cape
      gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off
      into the distance like a speeding bullet.
      
      EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - ESTABLISHING SHOT
      
      Grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned
      building overlooking the COAST. Once a place of knowledge and
      wonder - now home to a great evil.
      
      INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      The inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. The huge
      hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC
      EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have
      an obvious function FLASH and HUM.
      
      A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story
      MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS
      INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM-
      SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.
      
      He's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain
      could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE
      WITH A GIANT GREEN ""M"" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging
      at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES
      PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.
      
      Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO
      PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.
      
      A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other
      men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI.
      The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board,
      is dressed as the philosopher PLATO.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                I hate the outfits. I mean, I get
                it: we're all supposed to be
                ""masterminds"" - very clever.
                          (MORE)
                                                                3.
                          EINSTEIN(cont'd)
                I just feel stupid. I mean, what
                the hell did Einstein really do
                anyway?
      
                          PLATO
                Theory of relativity.
      
      Einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Well, you'd think he'd invent a
                wool sweater that didn't itch so
                much.
      
      Da Vinci and Plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they
      see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.
      
      Einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right
      shoulder and turns around.
      
      He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with
      his metal gauntlet.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                The real Einstein once said, ""God
                does not play dice with the world.""
                He was right, because the world is
                MY dice. Is that understood?
      
                          DA VINCI & PLATO
                Sir! Yes, sir!
      
                          EINSTEIN
                    (gasping for air)
                Yes, sir.
      
      Master Mind undoes his grip on Einstein's throat.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Alright, then - clean slate. Do we
                have the girl?
      
                          DA VINCI
                Yes, sir. She fell into our trap
                just like you knew she would.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Reporters are a curious lot, and
                easily manipulated.
      
      He quickly checks his physique in a GIANT MIRROR, adjusts his
      posture and sucks in his gut.
                                                                  4.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Alright, let's not keep the lady
                waiting.
      
      MOMENTS LATER
      
      Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE
      RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are
      standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away
      from us.
      
      She pulls free of Da Vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo
      the blindfold.
      
      Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking
      features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes
      that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
      
      The chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing Master
      Mind.
      
                          ROXANNE
                You didn't need to turn around like
                that. I can recognize the stench of
                failure.
      
      Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I trust you gentlemen know the very
                sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly
                regarded investigative journalist
                who some say has a more than
                friendly relationship with our
                super powered foe Uberman. And Miss
                Ritchi, I trust you've already met
                my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!
      
      Roxanne gives Einstein a once over.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Looks like a real group of winners.
                At the risk of sounding cliche',
                you'll never get away with this.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                In a way, I already have.
      
      Roxanne unleashes an exhausted SIGH.
                                                               5.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                We go through this every time. You
                kidnap me to get to Uberman, he
                immediately finds your hideout,
                escapes whatever lame trap you've
                come up with, and takes you and
                your cronies to jail. I propose we
                just save everybody some heartache
                this time by YOU letting me go, and
                ME forgetting this whole thing ever
                happened?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What about my revenge?
      
                          ROXANNE
                We can say it was wasting
                everyone's time.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                You have a wicked tongue. I hope
                you rid yourself of that when
                you're my queen.
      
      Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh.
      
                          ROXANNE
                I'm sorry. What makes you think I
                would want to be your queen?
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Power corrupts absolutely, Miss
                Ritchi. And when I have ultimate
                power over this city, I have
                absolutely every intention of
                corrupting you with it.
      
                          PLATO
                Sir!
      
      Master Mind turns to Plato who's now standing at a computer
      terminal.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (annoyed)
                What is it!?
      
      EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      Uberman flies toward the Observatory like a rocket.
                                                                  6.
      
      
      
      
      INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      Uberman crashes through the wall to the room we were just in.
      He looks around, but there's suddenly NOT A SOUL IN SIGHT.
      
                                                       CUT TO:
      
      EXT. MASTER MIND'S HYDROFOIL - DAY
      
      The boat is shooting through the ocean, away from the
      observatory.
      
      INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY
      
      Machines, cables and terminals criss-cross the craft's main
      bridge. Through the enormous surrounding windows we can see
      the observatory shrinking in the distance.
      
      Master Mind watches Uberman on a small TV monitor as the hero
      intently searches his hideout.
      
                          UBERMAN
                    (on monitor)
                Master Mind!
      
      INT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      Uberman throws up his arms in frustration when suddenly -
      
                          MASTER MIND (O.S.)
                Over here, old friend.
      
      He turns to see a FAMILIAR BLUE FACE OF EVIL ON A GIANT
      SCREEN.
      
                           UBERMAN
                What's the matter, miss your old
                jail cell?
      
      Uberman starts walking toward the monitor.
      
                          MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)
                Actually, I wanted to share the
                experience with my oldest friend.
      
      A MECHANIZED CAGE shoots out of the floor, suddenly trapping
      Metro City's protector.
      
      Totally unfazed, our hero stares on.
                                                                  7.
      
      
      
                           UBERMAN
                You can't possibly believe this
                will work.
      
      Master Mind pulls out a SMALL BLACK BOX with a SINGLE RED
      BUTTON on it.
      
                          MASTER MIND (ON MONITOR)
                Oh, can't I? I have attained
                control of the Earth's most
                abundant energy source. I doubt
                even you are strong enough to
                withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED
                POWER OF THE SUN!!!
      
      He presses the button.
      
      EXT. OUTER SPACE
      
      A sinister-looking SATELLITE orbits Earth's atmosphere. Its
      bay doors suddenly open, deploying two huge SOLAR PANELS.
      
      The panels shift, angling themselves in the direction of the
      sun. They immediately start GLOWING as they absorb the
      burning star's power.
      
      The front of the satellite begins to make a loud HUMMING
      SOUND as it prepares to unleash its unholy power.
      
      INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY
      
      From the giant window we can see the boat is a good mile from
      the observatory.
      
                          PLATO
                We're now at minimum safe distance,
                master.
      
      Master Mind turns from the CAMERA he was broadcasting on and
      puts down the control box.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Excellent. Stop here, I like this
                view.
      
                          PLATO
                Twenty seconds until impact.
      
      Master Mind turns to Roxanne who is being held by Da Vinci
      and Einstein. She almost appears a little bored.
      
      Disappointed by her lack of horror, he walks over to the
      monitor now showing Uberman trapped in the cage.
                                                               8.
      
      
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Any last words?
      
      Uberman looks up at the screen with a cocky smile.
      
                          UBERMAN (ON MONITOR)
                Yes: there's no caging the power of
                justice.
      
                          PLATO
                Ten seconds to impact.
      
      On the screen we see Uberman take two of the cage's bars in
      his hands. He yanks...NOTHING.
      
                           PLATO (CONT'D)
                Nine...
      
      Master Mind stares at the monitor, slightly confused.
      
                           PLATO (CONT'D)
                Eight...
      
      Uberman yanks on the bars again, this time using his foot as
      leverage.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                    (genuinely concerned)
                What's going on?
      
                          UBERMAN
                    (straining)
                Hold...on...a second.
      
      Master Mind looks back at Plato and Einstein. They're equally
      befuddled at the hero's sudden weakness.
      
                           PLATO
                Seven...
      
      Uberman loses his grip and FALLS BACKWARD ON HIS ASS.
      
                          UBERMAN
                SON OF A BITCH!!
      
      Master Mind and the minions all cringe in unison.
      
      Da Vinci turns to Roxanne not believing his ears.
      
                          DA VINCI
                What did he just say?
                                                               9.
      
      
      
                          PLATO
                Six......Five...
      
      Master Mind begins to laugh.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                What kind of trick is this?
      
      Uberman looks up at the camera with a very grave expression.
      
                          UBERMAN
                Like you don't know. These bars are
                made of copper, aren't they?
      
                             PLATO
                Four...
      
                             MASTER MIND
                Yeah, so?
      
      Uberman tries to shield his grief with his hand.
      
                          UBERMAN
                You figured out my weakness, damn
                you. I CAN'T BEND COPPER!
      
                             PLATO
                Three...
      
                          MASTER MIND
                Your weakness is copper?
      
                             PLATO
                Two...one.
      
      Everyone turns to the window.
      
      EXT. OUTER SPACE
      
      The satellite fires a giant BEAM OF LIGHT toward the earth.
      
      EXT. OBSERVATORY HIDEOUT - DAY
      
      The beam hits the observatory. The building instantly
      EXPLODES in a white nova blast of fire.
      
      INT. HYDROFOIL CONTROL ROOM - DAY
      
      The blast is so bright everyone turns away from the window.
      Then, as suddenly as it began, the awesome light dies out.
      
      One by one, the passengers unshield their eyes and look out
      toward the observatory.
                                                                10.
      
      
      
      All we can see through the haze of destruction is fire and
      smoke.
      
                          PLATO
                I don't think even he could have
                survived that.
      
      Einstein suddenly turns giddy with excitement.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Whoa! Is it me or did you just
                finally destroy Uberman?
      
                           MASTER MIND
                    (carefully skeptical)
                Well...let's not get ahead of
                ourselves.
      
      Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside.
      
                          DA VINCI
                Look, there's something in the sky,
                coming this way.
      
                           ROXANNE
                Uberman!
      
      Master Mind turns toward the window.
      
      An object is in the air, flying directly toward them. As it
      closes in we can just make out the FAMILIAR OUTLINE OF A
      CAPPED FIGURE.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE'S
                GONNA RAM US!!!
      
      Everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact.
      
      Master Mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn't know
      what to do with himself. He just covers his giant head with
      his hands.
      
      The figure CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and lands at his feet.
      
      He looks down to see a CHARRED BLACK HUMAN SKELETON. Around
      its neck is the unmistakable black cape of Uberman.
      
                           MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
                    (horrified)
                HOLY SHIT!
                                                              11.
      
      
      
      Roxanne breaks out of Da Vinci's hold and runs over to the
      body.
      
                           ROXANNE
                Uberman?
      
      She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered
      black cape with the yellow ""U"" on it.
      
      Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who's still visibly dumbfounded
      at the grotesque sight before him.
      
                          ROXANNE (CONT'D)
                You killed him!
      
      Roxanne's eyes roll back. Da Vinci catches her from behind as
      she FAINTS.
      
      Einstein turns to Master Mind, looking at him as if he's just
      walked on water.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                You did it!
      
      Now that he's committed the impossible - our villain is at a
      complete loss.
      
                          MASTER MIND
                ...so I did.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                I mean, I know you always wanted
                to. I mean, all the schemes all the
                plots - I never thought you'd
                actually be capable of it.
      
      Giddy as a school girl, Einstein turns to his fellow
      henchmen.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                This is history. Every villain and
                lackey in the history of villains
                and lackeys dream of this moment,
                but when does it actually EVER
                happen?
      
      A sudden realization comes over his face.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                Good lord...You do all realize what
                we get to do now, don't you?
                                                                 12.
      
      
      
      His question is met with acquisitive looks from Master Mind
      and the others.
      
                          EINSTEIN
                We get to go on a crime wave.

      ARMORED TRUCK
      
      It's driving along when the men inside suddenly notice
      something - THEY'RE FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE CITY STREETS.
      
      We PULL BACK to see the truck being carried by a giant claw
      at the bottom of a BRAIN COPTER.
      
      Inside the cockpit Master Mind and his henchmen laugh
      maniacally.

      Da Vinci and Einstein run out the front of the bank holding
      BAGS OF MONEY.
      
      Two beat officers see them and take chase after them around
      the corner and into an alley.
      
      After a moment the police reemerge from the alley screaming
      and running for their lives as a GIANT ROBOT CHASES after
      them.
      
      The robot stops, then suddenly it's head opens up like
      convertible car top with Master Mind and Plato at the
      driver's wheel.
      
      They smile and shake hands at a bad deed well done.
      
      SPINNING HEADLINE: ""MASTER MIND BLACKMAILS METRO!!!""
      
      A VICIOUS TORNADO
      
      It's heading for downtown Metro as Master Mind and the
      lackeys coolly look on.
      
      Three large DUMP TRUCKS pull up, filled to the brim with
      bricks of CASH.
                                                              13.
      
      
      
      The DRIVERS jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in
      the three trucks.
      
      Master Mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one
      when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward
      the tornado.
      
                           MASTER MIND
                    (absentmindedly)
                Oh, right.
      
      Master Mind pulls a television REMOTE from his pocket and
      aims it at approaching windstorm of death.
      
      He presses the button marked ""Tornado Off.""
      
      The tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the
      city.
      
      As they drive through the city streets, Master stares out the
      window with a hint of something in his eyes. Is it
      melancholy?
      
      END OF MONTAGE
      
      EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
      
      It's Metro City's premier bowling alley. On top of the neon
      lit building is a GIANT 30 FOOT TALL CEMENT BOWLING BALL.
      
      INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
      
      HAL STEWART (early 30's) takes careful aim with his BOWLING
      BALL.
      
                          HAL
                It's a sport of honor, focus and
                grace. Honor the ball, focus on the
                pins, release the ball not hard and
                fast, but as if you were releasing
                a baby dove.
      
      He takes a step, pulls back his arm, and releases the ball,
      following it with his eyes.
      
      It's a horrible shot - INSTANT GUTTER BALL.
      
      An aged barmaid type with a cigarette hanging from her mouth
      looks over at him.
      
                          HAL
                Okay, do something like that - but
                center it more.
                                                                14.
      
      
      
      She picks up her custom made FOGHAT BALL and takes aim.
      
                          ATTRACTIVE BLOND
                Tell me how my form looks, honey.
      
      Hal focuses on the misshapen bumps of her enormous Johnson
      administration era derriere.
      
                           HAL
                Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin'
                REAL good.
      
      It doesn't get anymore clear. This man is a pig.
      
                          VINNIE (O.S.)
                Hal, I want to see you in my
                office!
      
      Hal turns to see VINNIE, owner of the bowling alley, calling
      him.
      
                          VINNIE
                Now!
      
      INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - VINNIE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
      
      Hal sits down, facing Vinnie who's sitting at his desk.
      
                          VINNIE
                You're fired. Leave your shirt and
                locker key.
      
      This bit of news hits Hal like a freight train.
      
                          HAL
                Fired? Are you going to tell me
                why?
      
                          VINNIE
                Showing up to work late. Showing up
                to work late drunk. Sexually
                harassing customers. Stealing from
                the register.
      
                          HAL
                Vinnie, I don't know where you're
                getting these accusations -
      
      Vinnie takes out a video tape from his desk drawer and puts
      in a VCR.
                                                              15.
      
      
      
                              HAL
                   Oh, which one do you supposedly
                   have here?
      
                             VINNIE
                   This is all of them at once.
      
      TELEVISION
      
      A WOMAN walks up to a BOWLING EMPLOYEE and hands him a pair
      of shoes.
      
      As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and
      disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside.
      
                             HAL
                   I've got this one, Benny. So,
                   Cinderella. Can I help you find
                   your glass slipper?
      
                             WOMAN
                   Yeah, I'm looking for a seven.
      
      He folds his arms on the counter and leans into her with a
      cat-like grin on his face.
      
                             HAL
                       (with a leer)
                   Seven - Well, maybe I could
                   interest you in something in an
                   EIGHT. Namely, me.
      
      Disgusted, she walks off screen.
      
                             HAL
                   Lesbo.
      
      Suddenly realizing the register's open, he quickly grabs a
      stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket.
      
      BACK TO OFFICE
      
      Vinnie turns off the television and waits for Hal to respond.
      
                             HAL
                   From the angle of the camera, I can
                   see where you might have gotten the
                   wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't
                   think you've thought this through.
                   If you fire me, who's gonna be
                   captain of the alley's bowling
                   team?
                                                                16.
      
      
      
                          VINNIE
                Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody
                who can actually bowl. You guys
                have never won a game. I hired you
                because you said you were on the
                pro circuit.
      
                          HAL
                No, I said I WILL BE on the pro
                circuit.
      
                          VINNIE
                Please, a loser like you will never
                amount to anything.
      
      This harsh remark seems to leave Hal genuinely stunned.
      
                          HAL
                Wow...If that's how you feel...I
                guess we should then talk about
                what kind of severance I'm gonna
                get.
      
      EXT. KINGPIN BOWLING - DAY
      
      TWO BRUISERS open the door and throw Hal out onto the street.
      
      He quickly picks himself up and turns back toward the
      building.
      
                          HAL
                Hey...what about my ball?
      
      A bowling ball sails past him, just missing his head.
      
                             HAL
                Thank-you!
      
      EXT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - DAY
      
      The massive building with a giant 7 on the roof stands in the
      heart of Metro City.
      
      INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY
      
      The cubicles and offices are alive with the hustle and bustle
      of a busy news day.
      
      Phones are RINGING, REPORTERS are TALKING, and Editors are
      SHOUTING.
      
      The elevator doors open and out steps Roxanne Ritchi.
                                                              17.
      
      
      
      Everything stops as the entire office suddenly falls SILENT.
      
      Somewhat taken aback by the reaction, Roxanne scans the room
      to see every eye on her.
      
                          ROXANNE
                It's...um...It's good to be back.
                Thanks for everyone's cards and
                concerns. I really appreciated it -
                now I'm ready to climb back on the
                horse.
      
      No one is budging - their looks of pity are really starting
      to make her uncomfortable.
      
      The back office door suddenly opens and out comes FRANK
      BONIN, the gruff, middle-aged Producer of Channel 7 News.
      
      Noticing the silence, he looks up and sees the sad
      expressions on everybody's face.
      
                          FRANK
                Someone die or something?
      
      He suddenly notices Roxanne - both feet are placed firmly in
      his mouth.
      
                           FRANK
                    (cursing himself)
                Oh, Jesus.
      
                             ROXANNE
                It's okay.
      
      Frank quickly walks up to Roxanne and takes her gently by the
      arm.
      
                          FRANK
                Come on into my office, sweetie.
      
      INT. CHANNEL 7 NEWS BUILDING - FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
      
      He sits her down on his leather couch, then quickly turns
      toward his door.
      
                          FRANK
                Can we get this woman some water
                for God's sake?
                    (to Rebecca)
                I gave you two months off. What're
                you doing back? People are gonna
                think I'm a slave driver.
                                                              18.
      
      
      
                          ROXANNE
                Aren't you?
      
                          FRANK
                Yeah, but I don't want people to
                think it.
      
                          ROXANNE
                Frank, listen. I want to go back to
                work. I NEED to go back to work.
      
                          FRANK
                ...You're hysterical, aren't you?
      
      Frank sits down on the couch and blankets Roxanne with A WARM
      EMBRACE.
      
                          ROXANNE
                What're you doing?
      
                          FRANK
                Keeping you warm before you go into
                shock.
                    (toward the open door)
                DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP
                TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND
                HERE?
      
      A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it
      on the table in front of them and leaves.
      
      Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to
      face him.
      
                          ROXANNE
                It was a traumatic experience. Yes,
                everyone knows Uberman and me
                were...close. But what I really
                need - what would really make me
                better is getting back to work.
      
      There's a sudden awkward silence from Frank.
      
                          FRANK
                Well, that's going to be...
      
                          ROXANNE
                I thought you'd be happy to have me
                back.
                                            19.

      happier than to have our girl back,

MAIN CREDITS ROLL

over BLACK SCREEN, with PORTENTOUS SPOOKY MUSIC underneath. Just as the
music reaches its crescendo, we hear a simian SCREECH.

A BUCK-TOOTHED CARTOON MONKEY swings past on a vine. TITLE WIPES IN with
him:

                             MONKEYBONE(tm)
                                   in
                            ""FREUD CHICKEN!""

TIGHT CLOSEUP - STANLEY (ANIMATED)

A POCKETWATCH swings back and forth in F.G. Gaping at it is a goofy,
bespectacled CARTOON CHARACTER, sucking his thumb as his EYES move back
and forth. After a moment, the LEFT EYE freezes in place - but the right
eye keeps going back and forth with the watch.

                           SHRINK'S VOICE (o.s.)
            Back, Stanley...you're going back...back to when
            it all began. Are you going back yet? Come on,
            get back, ve haven't got all day.

Now BOTH EYES are locked in place. The patient is hypnotized.

INT. SCHOOLROOM - DAY (ANIMATED)

A squat, lumpy TEACHER, MISS HUDLAPP, is straining to erase the
Gettysburg Address, which is written along the very top of the
blackboard. There's an obtrusive, rhythmic BANGING noice in B.G.

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            It was third grade. The teacher was Miss
            Hudlapp. She was kinda squat and lumpy - she
            smelled funny - but she was kind.

                           MISS HUDLAPP
            CLASS!
                 (turning around suddenly)
            How many times have I told you? In this class we
            do not pound tenpenny nails into Stanley's head!


REVERSE ANGLE - ON STANLEY

Hapless ten-year-old STANLEY, still goofy and bespectacled, in his
front-row desk. NAILS stick out of his head. The FOUR MEAN KIDS poised
around him lower their hammers and return to their seats, grumbling.

A dreamy SMILE crosses STANLEY's face as he gazes at MISS HUDLAPP.

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            You know how some teachers have those, kind of,
            flaps on their arms - those big sacks of limp
            flab that like, dangle?

As MISS HUDLAPP pulls her sweater off, TWO MASSIVE ARM-FLAPS - fifty
gallons of flab apiece - SPILL OUT and SMACK INTO THE FLOOR.

MISS HUDDLAPP claps two erasers together, kicking up a cloud of dust.
Young STANLEY watches, transfixed by her massive ARM FLAPS. We TRACK IN
on the gigantic ARM FLAPS as they swing hypnotically back and forth,
with a loud SLAP each time they collide.

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            It sounds weird...but for some reason, as I
            watched those big old flaps of hers, I began to
            feel...well...oddly...

Now we TRACK IN on the mesmerized STANLEY. A SONG comes up underneath:
Donna Summer, ""I FEEL LOVE.""

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            ...aroused.
                 (beat)
            And then the horror began.

DOINK! STANLEY looks down at his LAP in horror. The boys and girls
around him are pointing and tittering.

Grimacing in embarrassment, he discreetly places a heavy TEXTBOOK onto
his lap, suppressing the bulge in his pants. But SPROING!! - the BOOK
goes flying across the room. The BULGE is fighting back!

The kids DUCK AND COVER beneath their desks as STANLEY slams a STACK of
textbooks onto his lap. It's no use - the WHOLE STACK goes flying, and
BOOKS come raining down on the entire class! Now MISS HUDLAPP is staring
directly at him...

                           MISS HUDLAPP
            Young man. What's that in your lap?

She marches toward him. STANLEY pulls his BACKPACK over his lap.

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            It was useless. Like putting a baseball cap on
            the Washington Monument. And then...all at once
            ...there he was.

The BACKPACK bucks and wriggles, as if something inside is trying to GET
OUT. And then - with a flourish of rousing disco strings - IT DOES!

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            Monkeybone!!

The libidinous cartoon monkey BURSTS OUT of the backpack, POINTS at MISS
HUDLAPP - and announces, in his Barry White baritone:

                           MONKEYBONE
            Oooo-oo-ooh, baby. I love your way.

KC and the SUNSHINE BAND comes up underneath as MONKEYBONE DANCES to the
front of the class. He grabs MISS HUDLAPP by the hands and begins
dancing The Bump with her ARM FLAPS. Butt left, WHAP. Butt right, WHAP.

The KIDS are bug-eyed - agog. With each WHAP their little heads turn
back and forth as if they're watching a nude tennis match.


INT. SCREENING ROOM - ON AUDIENCE (LIVE-ACTION)

A roomful of LIVE HUMANS watching the cartoon, heads turning in sync
with the kids onscreen. TV-INDUSTRY HIPSTERS, AD EXECS, MANUFACTURER'S
REPS...they're all guests at this sneak preview of the Monkeybone show,
and they're LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY.

In the midst of the crowd is a handsome young couple: JULIE McELROY and
STU MILEY. JULIE's a research scientist, brainy, professional,
abnormally well-adjusted - and pretty enough that she'd be intimidating
if it weren't for a prominent goofy streak.

STU is the one guy in the auditorium who isn't laughing at the cartoon
on the screen. In fact, he's solemn as a judge - peering nervously
around to see how the rest of the audience is responding.

Why? Because he's the cartoonist who created the characters on screen.
In his looks (gangly, disheveled) and manner (sardonic, self-
deprecating), he's the obvious model for the character of STANLEY.

INT. CLASSROOM (ANIMATED)

As the monkey dance continues, we ZOOM IN on the mortified face of
LITTLE STANLEY. His eyes begin doing the familiar HYPNO-SWIRL...

INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE (ANIMATED)

A CUCKOO pops out of a wall clock. ADULT STANLEY'S THUMB pops out of his
mouth. He awakens from his trance in a cold sweat.

                           STANLEY
            How about it, Doc? Can you help me?

                           SHRINK
            Not overnight. These imaginary monkey cases take
            time. I vould estimate...roughly...

On the desk is a CATALOGUE, open to a two-page spread depicting a 40-
foot CABIN CRUISER. ""NEW FOR SUMMER! ONLY $229,999.95!"" With his free
hand, the SHRINK is working a CALCULATOR...

                           SHRINK
            Twelve years and three months ought to do it.

The SHRINK hustles STANLEY to the door and shakes his hand.

                           STANLEY
            One question, doc - what did you mean when you
            said ""imaginary""?

                           SHRINK
            All in good time, my boy. All in good time.

The SHRINK shoves STANLEY out and slams the door behind him. Two beats.
Then he doubles over, WEEPING with LAUGHTER.

                           SHRINK
            Vot a crackpot! Monkey on ze back - HAH!! ROLL
            OUT ZE WACKY WAGON!!

Now he notices a BACKPACK, which STANLEY has left on the couch. It
TWITCHES slightly - of its own free will.

                           VOICE IN BACKPACK
            Imaginary, huh? You quack.


EXT. SHRINK'S BUILDING (ANIMATED)

A WINDOW shatters. The SHRINK comes hurtling out. MONKEYBONE STRADDLES
HIM like Slim Pickens riding an H-bomb, hootin' and hollerin' all the
way down to the street.

SPLAT! A gob of gore hits STANLEY in the face as he exits the building.
He kneels on the sidewalk - finding a PIPE and a GOATEE.

                           STANLEY
            Aw, Monkeybone! At this rate I'll never find a
            good shrink.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Those guys are a waste of money! I'll show you
            how to stop sucking your thumb...

MONKEYBONE sticks his thumb in his butt as he and STANLEY toddle off
into the sunset.

INT. SCREENING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

STANDING O from the crowd as the cartoon ends and the lights come up.
HERB, an all-purpose sidekick type, appears at the podium:

                           HERB
            Thank you...that's our pilot...the good news is,
            Comedy Channel has just picked us up with an
            order for six new episodes!

HERB leads a round of APPLAUSE. JULIE nudges STU - the only guy in the
room who's still in his seat.

                           HERB
            Now, let's give it up for the guy who started it
            all. Creator of America's most disturbed comic
            strip...the man behind the monkey...Mister Stu
            Miley!

A SPOTLIGHT hits him, and he STANDS to tumultuous applause. He looks
genuinely stunned. He can't believe it's happening.

JULIE surreptitiously PINCHES him on the bottom, giving him a start. She
WINKS at him. He shoots her a small private smile - then turns to WAVE
at the adoring crowd.

INT. LOBBY - HALF-HOUR LATER - NIGHT

STU working his way through a crowd of well-wishers and FANS.

                           STU
            I don't actually draw all the animation, no. We
            have sweatshop workers who couldn't get jobs at
            Nike doing that.

A beautiful, heavily-pierced FEMALE FAN hands STU a marker.

                           BEAUTIFUL FAN
            Mr. Miley, would you draw Monkeybone on my
            belly? As a guide?

                           STU
            Guide...?

                           BEAUTIFUL FAN
            For my tattoo artist?

She exposes her taut midriff. STU thinks for a moment, then goes to
work. When he's done, Monkeybone appears to be climbing out of the
girl's pants and WAVING to her. Nearby FANS APPLAUD.

                           BEAUTIFUL FAN
            Wait! You have to draw the rest of him -

She begins unbuckling her belt so STU will have enough room to draw
Monkeybone's bottom half. STU demurs...

                           STU
            I - I have to, uh, check in with my doctor. DO-
            OCCCC!!

He wanders across the room, finds JULIE deep in conversation with a
bunch of other GUESTS, and pulls her aside.

                           STU
            Hey, Doc. Come here. There's something really
            cool I want to show you.

He grabs her by the sleeve, pulls her across the floor to -

INT. ALCOVE - OFF LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

There's nothing ""cool"" about it - it's a stairway landing, with metal
fire doors that open onto the parking lot outside.

                           STU
            See these doors? The cool thing is, you go out
            ...they close...you can't get back in!

He opens one door and holds it for JULIE.

                           JULIE
            You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit!
            Everyone loves you!

                           STU
            They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.

                           JULIE
            It was you who got the standing O. It was you
            drawing on the belly over there...

                           STU
            That was especially Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I
            don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of
            media creeps. I just want to be us. Home. Alone!
                 (conspiratorially)
            I have something I have to give you.

                           JULIE
            Can't you give it to me later?

                           STU
            Yeah, I could, but the thing is, if later got
            here sooner, it would be...better.

He gives up trying to explain...pulls her close and kisses her. For a
moment they completely forget about the party in the next room.

Then HERB appears behind them, trying to catch STU's eye as he waits for
the clinch to break up. Finally he pries them apart:

                           HERB
            Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I
            know you don't like the idea, but you really
            ought to talk to these guys -

                           STU
            Julie and I - we were just gonna go...

But before STU knows what's hit him, HERB is leading him back to -


INT. LOBBY - THAT MOMENT - CONTINUOUS

                           HERB
            Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You
            got three major toy companies...you got the guys
            from Burger God over here...

                           STU
            Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in
            the french fries?

                           HERB
            Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre-
            emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -

The MERCHANDISERS shoot STU an expectant wave. STU waves back and turns
in the opposite direction. HERB grabs him by the sleeve.

                           STU
            Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.

                           HERB
            Do you know what kind of opportunity you have
            here? You gotta strike. I'm talking mansions.
            Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you
            brush your teeth!

                           STU
            I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!

                           HERB
            Being rich is not a trap. That is a dirty lie
            perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures
            from killing them.

                           STU
            Herb. I have to go.

                           HERB
            Why?

                           STU
            I got the ring.
                 (beat)
            Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.

He nods toward JULIE, who's at the open bar grabbing two glasses of
punch. HERB realizes a proposal is in the works.

                           HERB
            Oh my God...you're proposing?

                           STU
            My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she...
            fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never
            been. She loves me the way I am - right now.
                 (beat)

            I don't want everything to change. I don't want
            her saying yes to some big success. I just want
            her saying yes to me.

                           HERB
            ...In some weird way I respect that.

JULIE's over by the punchbowl. She sees the two boys staring at her
conspiratorially - MAKES A FACE at them as she waves back.

                           HERB
            Okay then. If I get you out of here - you pop
            the question - tonight. Or else. Get me?

STU nods gravely.

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

STU, JULIE, and HERB in the parking lot. A small safari of FLUNKIES is
loading enormous boxes full of MONKEYBONE JUNK into STU's beat-up car -
stuffed dolls, action figures, board games, lunchboxes, beach towels,
team jackets and more! STU groans at the sight of it...

                           HERB
            They're just prototypes...take 'em home and look
            at 'em before you say no...
                 (scanning the streets)
            If you could just hold on a minute or two, we're
            expecting a couple more trucks.

STU GLOWERS at HERB as he opens the car door for JULIE.

                           HERB
            Okay, okay! You're a beautiful couple. Go.

INT. CAR - NIGHT - MOVING

STU backs out of his space. The small parking lot is full of DELIVERY
TRUCKS from would-be merchandisers - all too large for the spaces
they're parked in. STU has to keep backing up because the exit lanes are
blocked. It's like negotiating a labyrinth.

                           STU
            Look at this! He won't let us leave!

                           JULIE
            Who?

                           STU
            The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over
            both our lives if we let him.

                           JULIE
            Stu - stop it. That monkey is good luck. You
            thought him up, and everybody loves him, and
            he's probably going to make you rich. So relax!
            Enjoy it!

                           STU
            I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had
            any good luck, until I met you...what if it's
            all just another bad dream?

                           JULIE
            What's the ""bad"" part?

                           STU
            I might wake up.

                           JULIE
                 (laughing; taking his hand)

            If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So
            face it. You're just going to have to be happy!

                           STU
            I am happy. It just so happens this is the
            happiest night of my life.

He says it so solemnly that she cracks up. After a moment he joins in.

EXT. PARKING LOT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

A PLASTIC BANNER stretches between two poles on either side of the entry
to the lot. It shows MONKEYBONE in a typical languorous pose:

                  It's His World. We Just Live in It!
                               MONKEYBONE
                        Sunday Nights This Fall

TWO GUYS on EXTENSION LADDERS are taking the sign down as STU'S CAR
idles at the exit below. There's a strong wind tonight, and one guy
LOSES HOLD of his end of the banner just as he gets it detached...

INT. CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

As STU pulls into the intersection he sees a DELIVERY TRUCK approaching
in the opposite lane, with a cardboard likeness of MONKEYBONE mounted
atop the cab. He chuckles...

                           STU
            That damn monkey is everywh--

Suddenly his view of the street DISAPPEARS. The MONKEYBONE BANNER has
fallen DIRECTLY ACROSS HIS WINDSHIELD, like a huge SHROUD. All he can
see is a great, grinning MONKEY FACE!!

JULIE SCREAMS. STU SCREAMS. Unable to see, he slams on the brakes and
JERKS THE WHEEL RIGHT.

Off screen: HORNS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. The horrible crunch of METAL
ON METAL.

But Stu's car comes to a halt untouched. After a moment he opens his
eyes...and JULIE opens hers...

                           STU
            Did we just - hit something?

                           JULIE
            I don't think so.

                           STU
            Are you okay??

She thinks it over, nods. STU takes a moment to catch his breath, then
opens the door gingerly. A HORN BLARES as a car speeds past in the
opposite lane, nearly taking STU's door off. He jumps back inside,
waits, opens the door again...

EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT

His eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene. The
asphalt is strewn with MONKEYBONE MERCHANDISE - stuffed dolls, games,
lunchboxes. SKID MARKS show where the TRUCK which was carrying all this
SWERVED...

...and slammed into the rear of a BUICK REGAL, pinning it up against a
TELEPHONE POLE. STU races up to the Buick. Its front end is mashed up
like an accordion, but the occupants - a couple of TEENAGERS dressed for
the prom - seem to be okay.

                           STU
            Hey! Are you guys all right in there?

                           TEENAGE GIRL
            We're fine.

                           STU
            That stupid monkey banner! It fell on my
            windshield - it practically killed us all!
                 (to JULIE)
            God, Julie, if anything had happened to you -

                           JULIE
            I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.

                           STU
            I'd better go report this...

He spots a PHONE BOOTH and starts across the street. On the way there he
plucks a STUFFED MONKEYBONE DOLL off the pavement and CHOKES IT with
both hands.

JULIE stays behind with the prom kids. The TEENAGE BOY in his tux is
glassy-eyed, miserable beyond description.

                           JULIE
            Dad's car?

The BOY begins to SOB softly. JULIE nods in sympathy.

Then: EVERYONE WINCES. The air is full of a horrible CREAKING noise,
like nails on a blackboard...

                           TEENAGE GIRL
            What was that? Did you hear that?

The horrible CREAKING NOISE continues. JULIE turns. Behind her, the
TELEPHONE POLE that the car slammed into is beginning to TEETER. Then it
TOPPLES. Directly toward...

                           JULIE
            STU!!

ON STU - IN PHONE BOOTH

He sees JULIE running toward him and holds up a single finger.

                           STU
            Operator? I want to report an accident.

Finally he glances up - just in time to see the TELEPHONE POLE coming
down toward the phone booth like a gigantic sledgehammer. His eyes
widen. The STUFFED MONKEYBONE slips from his grasp...

CLOSEUP - MONKEYBONE

A HORRIBLE CRASH. SCREAMS. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the MONKEYBONE DOLL which
STU was holding, surrounded by broken glass, its face twisted into an
insane, almost macabre grin.

The screen fades to PITCH BLACK for a few seconds...until we hear a
DISTANT SIREN, and an IMAGE comes swimming into focus...

STU'S POV: ON JULIE

He's in the back of an ambulance, with PARAMEDICS all around him,
working feverishly. JULIE hovers above him, holding his hand.

                           JULIE
            Stu? I'm here, baby. It's me. It's Julie. I love
            you. You're gonna be okay, baby, I promise -

All at once he seems to be RECEDING from JULIE and the others - as if
SINKING THROUGH the bottom of the stretcher, and BEYOND - through the
floor of the ambulance! JULIE's voice grows weaker, more distant:

                           JULIE (V.O.)
            I'm here, baby. I won't leave you...

And then all trace of the ambulance is gone, and he's floating down
through some strange LIMBO, surrounded by the silhouettes of billowing
SHROUDS, with the sound of BIRDS CALLING all around him...

An AWFUL MECHANICAL RATCHETING NOISE fills the soundtrack. STU's eyes
close - and when they reopen, he finds himself in:

EXT. TROLLEY - MOVING

A tiny ROLLER-COASTER CAR descends from dense clouds down the length of
an impossibly long and rickety METAL TRACK. The track leads through a
vast black VOID...

...to a tiny ISLAND floating in the darkness...an island that looks not
unlike a disembodied FIST.

And, as the car draws closer, the fist begins to OPEN - tulip-like -
turning into a HAND, with a full-sized TOWN nestled in its palm! In the
town, CARNIVAL LIGHTS begin to glitter. MUSIC begins to tinkle...


EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT

The car - a one-passenger job with a CARTOON ANIMAL FACE on its prow -
stops with a lurch. STU steps out onto a fog-shrouded TRAIN STATION
PLATFORM. Before he knows it, the little car DEPARTS behind him. He's
stranded - alone.

                           STU
            Hello? Anybody? - Am I dead?
                 (beat)
            PLEASE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF I'M DEAD.

Off in the fog is a big wheeled CART with the sign: ""PSYCHOLOGICAL
BAGGAGE CLAIM."" There STU finds two SUITCASES and a BACKPACK. He
examines the TAGS. They all belong to him!

He sits on the edge of the cart, opens a SUITCASE, and pulls out...

 - A bagged copy of Marvel Comics' Conan the Barbarian #1;

 - An 8mm reel of highlights from Ray Harryhausen's Jason and the
   Argonauts, with swordfighting skeletons on the box cover;

 - A SPIRAL NOTEBOOK, its cover labelled ""STU M. - GEOGRAPHY,"" its
   inside pages covered with drawings of dinosaurs and airplanes;

 - Transparent plastic models of ""THE VISIBLE MAN"" and his mate, ""THE
   VISIBLE WOMAN,"" with a couple of spare organs that young STU never
   quite found a place for;

 - A vinyl LP of ""BREAD'S GREATEST HITS,"" which STU quickly slips back
   into the suitcase lest anyone see it.

As he gathers his bags, he hears odd SQUEAKS and CHITTERING...

                           RACCOON (o.s.)
            Carry your bags, mister?

A STRANGE FURRY CREATURE pops out from beneath the platform and yanks on
STU's pants leg. It looks like a raccoon, but it's FLAT - an animated
pelt. Before STU has time to let out a yell, a FLAT SNAKESKIN comes
slithering out from beneath the baggage cart...

                           SNAKE
            Cigars, mister? Genuine Coobans!

STU looks down and sees a SQUASHED RABBIT humping his leg.

                           RABBIT
            Wanna meet my sister?

These bordertown types are known as ROADKILL, and they're sporting the
tire tracks to prove it. STU SCREAMS, shakes them off, and RUNS.

EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT

A long stone STAIRWAY leads to decorative wrought-iron GATES. SHADOWY
CARVED SPHINXES sit on either side. As STU races up the steps, a
sputtering NEON SIGN comes to life overhead:

                               D RK TOWN

A FANFARE BLOWS as the creaky gates begin to part. A SPOTLIGHT hits the
SPHINXES - and they COME TO LIFE! They rise up on their hind legs, put
on boater hats. One of them blows a note on a kazoo...

                           SINGING SPHINXES
            Weeee...welcome you to Dark Town
            And while you're in your coma
            This odd amusement park-town
            Will be your Home Sweet Homa -

STU bolts THROUGH THE GATES, with the ROADKILL TRIO right on his heels.
The indignant SPHINXES exchange a look of outrage.

EXT. DARK TOWN - MIDWAY - NIGHT

It's a carny town, a tourist trap, seedy and nightmarish. Despite the
festive trappings, there's something off about it - an air of neglect
and decrepitude - as if they'd tried to turn Alcatraz into Disneyland,
and given up halfway through.

STU looks back and sees the ROADKILL gaining on him. He spots a small
group of OTHER HUMANS...

                           STU
            Help me. Please. There's animals. They -

The humans just YAWN. They're COMA VICTIMS, just like STU. He ditches
one of his SUITCASES as the ROADKILL come after him.

                           VOICE
            Pony ride, Mister?

He turns and spots a helpful-looking fellow in a COWBOY OUTFIT. The
COWBOY is in fact a CENTAUR - rider and mount rolled into one!

The characters who run this place - the BARKERS, TICKET-TAKERS, and RIDE
OPERATORS - are all weird HYBRIDS, part human, part ANIMAL. They could
be the ancient Gods of some primitive culture - reduced to working as
street entertainers in this ramshackle resort town.

STU pinballs down the street, bouncing from one shock to another:

 - JOE CAMEL, doing community service as a STREET SWEEPER -

                           JOE CAMEL
            Hey, Mister. Mister! Got a smoke?

 - a YETI selling SNO-CONES from a cart outside the MORPHEUM THEATRE.
   The marquee reads:

                        LIVE! NIGHTMARES! LIVE!
          First-Run - Continuous Performances - Popular Prices
                Rated NR-H - Not Recommended for Humans

 - A CYCLOPS working as a barker at the Penny Arcade;

 - A VIDEO RENTAL OUTLET - ""BAD DREAMS VIDEO,"" offering your favorite
   nightmares, cult and classic, three nights for $2.95. A THREE-HEADED
   DEVIL emerges from the shop carrying a sackful of videos - and
   recognizes STU, much to his horror.

                           HEAD #1
            Hey, aren't you Stu Miley?

                           HEAD #2
            We're big fans.

                           HEAD #3
            Could we have your autograph?

Reduced to babbling hysteria, STU ducks into the nearest building. Above
the door, an ANIMATED NEON SIGN shows a happy boozer lifting his martini
glass, then falling over flat on his back, at which point his eyes are
replaced by the traditional cartoon X's. This is the COMA BAR.


INT. COMA BAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

STU bursts in, flattens himself against the wall as the ROADKILL skitter
past outside. He's given them the slip. He looks around.

The bar's a weird melange of styles. COMA VICTIMS ride around in
wheelchairs refurbished as BUMPER CARS, drinking cocktails from IV
bottler. A four-armed ELEPHANT GOD is at the Mighty Wurlitzer while a
MERMAID VOCALIST in a half-shell belts out the wistful lyrics of Johnny
Mercer's ""DREAM."" And over at the BAR...

                           BULL (o.s.)
            New in town, huh? What're you drinking?

Out of breath, STU edges toward the bar as the BARTENDER, BULL, turns
away to grab a fresh glass.

                           STU
            Chasing me - animals - horrible -

                           BULL
            Animals? What kind of animals?

STU GAGS. BULL is a full-fledged MINOTAUR, body of a man, head of a
BULL. His features are CUBIST - weirdly squashed over to one side.

                           BULL
            Yeah, I know - Picasso. Guernica, right? That's
            what everybody says - although personally, I
            don't see the resemblance. What are you
            drinking?

                           STU
            Uhh - martini?

                           BULL
            Olive or eyeball?

                           STU
            Olive. - Where exactly am I?

                           BULL
            Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.

                           STU
            Stu Miley.

                           BULL
            Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're
            quite a celebrity down here.

STU gives him a cockeyed look. BULL points to a MONITOR mounted over the
bar, on which a panicked man in pajamas is trying to run barefoot
through a great sticky SEA OF MOLASSES.

                           BULL
            I told you, it's the land of nightmares. Same on
            every channel...all the stuff people dream,
            after they have the extra anchovies.

He changes channels with a remote. Now we see a guy falling through
midair, arms and legs flailing, falling, falling, falling...

                           STU
            Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.

                           BULL
            Sad commentary, huh?

Now a small muffled VOICE speaks from the area of STU'S BACKPACK:

                           DISEMBODIED VOICE (o.s.)
            ""Bull,"" huh? That's cute. What's your last name
            - ""Shit""??

                           BULL
                 (turning angrily to STU)
            I beg your pardon?

                           STU
            I didn't say anything.

                           VOICE (o.s.)
            Nice face. Lemme guess. You were in a bullfight
            ...with a Mack Truck!!

STU claps both hands over his mouth to prove he's not the one talking.
BULL glowers at him, snorting STEAM out of both nostrils.

                           STU
            I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...

                           BULL
            Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of ventriloquist
            here.

The ELEPHANT GOD from the Wurlitzer organ comes lumbering over.

                           VOICE (o.s.)
            Well, hello, sailor. Get a lot of dates with
            that ding-dong on your face??

BULL and JUMBO rear back to PUNCH STU'S LIGHTS OUT. He's saying his
prayers when his BACKPACK begins to BULGE and QUIVER - and a SMALL FURRY
BEAST pops out, CACKLING HIS HEAD OFF!!

                           MONKEYBONE
            Just kiddin', folks! Drinks for everybody -
                 (pointing at STU)

            On him!! HIYA, BOSS!!

BULL and JUMBO back off, STUNNED. The monkey grabs STU'S FACE and plants
a big wet SMOOCH right on his NOSE. STU SCREAMS.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

TIGHT ON an EEG monitor. There's a sudden BLIP on the readout.

                           NURSE
            Just a spike, ma'am. It happens. It's perfectly
            natural with coma patients.

                           JULIE
            I'm a doctor too. I know this man's brain -

JULIE strokes STU's limp hand. He's COMATOSE, cocooned in a tangle of
wires and tubes. His head and shoulders are heavily bandaged. He's
hooked up to as much machinery as you can cram into one room.

                           DOCTOR
            Go home, Doctor. Rest. Come back when you can do
            us some good.

INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

Dead on her feet, JULIE stumbles toward the exit. As she's leaving she
passes the WAITING ROOM -

                           WOMAN'S VOICE
            Julie?

She turns and sees an older colleague from work - ALICE - waiting in the
doorway. Hovering right behind ALICE is HERB. And behind him -

It appears that almost everyone in the waiting room is a friend of JULIE
and STU's. Disheveled and groggy, they rouse themselves and make their
way over to JULIE's side. She's overcome with emotion.

INT. STU & JULIE'S HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT

The sound of the key in the lock is met by INSANE BARKING. JULIE and
ALICE enter and are met by BUSTER, the pet basset - jumping and yipping
like crazy after 24 hours without food or human company.

                           ALICE
            Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.

                           JULIE
            Oh, poo"
27	Mulan	Robert D. San Souci	Family,Animation,Comedy,Musical,Adventure	December_1998	"[Chinese guard is seen walking on The Great Wall.  Shan-Yu's falcon swoops
down and hits the guard on the head knocking his helmet off.  The falcon lands
on top of a flag pole in front of a full moon and lets out a large cry.  One
grappling hook comes over The Great Wall.  The guard walks over to the edge
and sees many grappling hooks coming towards him]

Guard [yelling]:  We're under attack!  Light the signal!

[Guard runs to the tower and up the ladder as Hun Bald Man #1 and Hun Long
Hair Man appear trying to stop him.  Hun Bald Man #1 breaks the ladder with
his sword just as Guard reaches the top.  The guard picks up the torch to
light the fire and sees Shan-Yu jump over the edge of the tower and looks at
him across from the caldron.  The guard throws the torch into the caldron
lighting a large fire.  Shan-Yu watches as each tower lights their caldrons
one by one]

Guard [sternly]:  Now all of China knows you're here.

Shan-Yu [taking the flag and holding it over the fire]:  Perfect.

[Cut to the palace.  The large doors to the central chamber open as General Li
walks in flanked on his left and right by soldiers and approaches the Emperor. 
He bows, then looks up]

General Li:  Your Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern border.

Chi Fu:  Impossible! No one can get through The Great Wall.  [The Emperor
motions for Chi Fu's silence]

General Li:  Shun-Yu is leading them.  We'll set up defenses around your
palace immediately.

Emperor [forcefully]:  No!  Send your troops to protect my people.  Chi Fu, 

Chi Fu:  Yes, your highness.

Emperor: Deliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces.  Call up
reserves and as many new recruits as possible.

General Li:  Forgive me your Majesty, but I believe my troops can stop him.

Emperor:  I wont take any chances, General.  A single grain of rice can tip
the scale.  One man may be the difference between victory and defeat.

[Cut to Mulan using her chopsticks to single out a grain of rice on top of the
mound of rice]

Mulan: Quiet and demure...graceful...polite...[picking up some rice with her
chopsticks and eating a mouthful] delicate...refined...poised... [She sets
down her chopsticks and writes down a final word on her right arm] punctual.
[A cock crows]  Aiya.  [Calling out]  Little brother. Little brother.  Lit-
ahhh, there you are.  Who's the smartest doggie in the world?  Come on smart
boy, can you help me with my chores today?

[Mulan ties a sack of grain around Little Brother's waist.  She ties a stick
onto Little brother so that end of it is in front of Little Brother's face. 
She ties the bone on the end of the stick just out of reach.  Little Brother
begins to run after the bone which he cannot reach.  Mulan opens the door for
Little Brother and he runs into the door frame, then out the open door. 
Little brother runs by the chickens and Khan - the family horse]

[Cut to Mulan's Father, Fa Zhou, kneeling and praying before the Fa family's
ancestors]

Fa Zhou:  Honorable ancestors, please help Mulan impress the matchmaker today. 


Little Brother [running into the temple and around Fa Zhou scattering grain
around the floor]: Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.

[The chickens follow Little Brother into the temple and begin to feed on the
grain]

Fa Zhou:  Please, PLEASE, help her.

[Mulan steps up to the temple seeing Little Brother on his hind legs trying to
get the bone.  Mulan bends the stick down so that Little brother can reach the
bone.  Little brother gnaws on the bone happily.  Mulan continues toward the
temple]

Mulan [calling out]: Father I brought your--whoop!  [Fa Zhou bumps into Mulan. 
The cup falls to the ground and Fa Zhou catches the teapot with the handle of
his cane]

Fa Zhou:  Mulan--

Mulan:  I brought a spare. [Mulan pulls out a cup from underneath the back of
her dress and begins to pour the tea]  

Fa Zhou:  Mulan--

Mulan [hurried]: Remember, the doctor said three cups of tea in the morning--

Fa Zhou:  Mulan--

Mulan:  And three at night. 

Fa Zhou:  Mulan, you should already be in town.  We're counting on you to up--

Mulan:  --uphold the family honor.  Don't worry father.  I wont let you down. 
[Mulan covers over the writing on her arm with here sleeve]  Wish me luck. 
[Mulan hurries down the stairs]

Fa Zhou [calling out]:  Hurry!  [to himself] I'm going to...pray some more.
[Fa Zhou turns and walks back into the temple]

[Cut to the town with Fa Li looking worried]

Bath Lady [poking out of her building]:  Fa Li, is your daughter here yet? 
The matchmaker is not a patient woman.  [She goes back into the building]

Fa Li:  Of all days to be late.  I should have prayed to the ancestors for
luck.

Grandma Fa [walking in with a Cri-Kee in a cage]:  How lucky can they be,
they're dead.  Besides,  I've got all the luck we'll need.  [Speaking to
Cri-Kee]  This is your chance to prove yourself.  [Cri-Kee chirps approvingly. 
Grandma Fa covers her eyes steps into a busy street]

Fa Li [excitedly]:  Grandma No!

[The traffic barely misses Grandma Fa as she crosses the busy street.  But two
horse and carriage collide causing a big accident.  She arrives at the other
side of the street, uncovers here eyes and looks at Cri-Kee]

Grandma Fa:  Yep, this cricket's a lucky one. [Cri-Kee falls over out of
fright]

Fa Li [sighing in relief]:  Hai.

[Mulan arrives on Khan jumping over the recent accident in the street and
jumps off with hay stuck in her hair]

Mulan: I'm here.  [Seeing a stern look from her mother] What?  But Mama I had
to--

Fa Li:  None of your 'xcuses.  Now let's get you cleaned up. [They walk
together into the preparation area]

[Song: Honor to us all]

Bath Lady:  [all the while Bath Lady undresses Mulan and pushes her into the
Bath]
This is what you give me 
to work with?
Well, honey, I've seen worse.
We're gonna turn 
this sow's ear
Into a silk purse. [Bath Lady moves the silk partition aside showing Mulan in
the bath] 

Mulan [spoken]:  It's freezing.

Fa Li [spoken]:  It would have been warm if you were here on time.  

Bath Lady [washing Mulan's hair]:
We'll have you
Washed and dried
Primped and polished 
till you glow with pride
Trust my recipe for 
instant bride
You'll bring honor to us all

Fa Li [grabbing a sponge and Mulan's right arm to start cleaning her.  She
notices the writing] [spoken]:  Mulan, what's this?

Mulan [Drawing her arm back and batting her eyelashes] [spoken]:  Ahh, notes,
in case I forget something?

Grandma Fa [spoken]:  Here, hold this [hands the cricket to Fa Li].  We'll
need more luck than I thought.  [Mulan looks on with an air of disappointment]

[Cut to the hair dressers]

Hair Dresser 1 [Brushing and combing Mulan's hair much to Mulan's chagrin]:
Wait and see
When we're through

Hair Dresser 2:
Boys will gladly go to 
war for you

Hair Dresser 1:
With good fortune 

Hair Dresser 2 [Finalizing the hairdo to look exactly like hers]:
And a great hairdo

Both:
You'll bring honor to us all

Fa Li and others:  [Mulan following her Mother passes a xiangqi game and
pauses to make an impressive move.  Mulan has a smug look on her face when Fa
Li comes back and drags Mulan away]
A girl can bring her family
Great honor in one way
By striking a good match
And this could be the day

Dresser 1 [Dresser 1, Dresser 2, and Fa Li dress Mulan]:
Men want girls 
with good taste

Dresser 2:
Calm

Fa Li:
Obedient

Dresser 1:
Who work fast-paced

Fa Li:
With good breeding

Dresser 2 [Pulling the dress tight around her waist]:
And a tiny waist 

Mulan [expressing her waist being squeezed tight] [spoken]: huh.

All Three:
You'll bring honor to us all 

Chorus:  [Mulan follows Fa Li and sees boy stealing a doll from a girl.  Mulan
grabs the doll from the boy and returns it to its owner]
We all must serve 
our Emperor
Who guards us from the Huns
A man by bearing arms
A girl by bearing sons 

Make-up Lady/Fa Li: [Putting on Mulan's face, powder, lipstick and eye liner]
[in a 3 person round]
 When we're through 
you can't fail
Like a lotus blossom 
soft and pale
How could any fellow 
say ""No sale""
You'll bring honor to us all
[Make-Up Lady holds a mirror so Mulan can see her reflection.  Not looking
pleased, Mulan takes her single, short bang and brings it down in front of her
forehead and smiles]

Fa Li [spoken. Fa Li places a hair comb in Mulan's hair]:  There, you're
ready.

Grandma Fa [spoken]:  Not yet! An apple for serenity [putting an apple in
Mulan's mouth]...A pendant for balance [places a yin-yang pendant under her
sash] [sings]

Beads of jade for beauty [putting beads around Mulan's neck]
You must proudly show it [Grandma Fa raises her chin high with her hand]
Now add a cricket just for luck [putting the cage with Cri-Kee under Mulan's
sash in the back.  Cri-Kee doesn't look pleased]
And even you can't blow it

Mulan:  [Walking to catch up with the other maidens]
Ancestors
Hear my plea
Help me not to make a fool of me
And to not uproot my fam'ly tree
Keep my father standing tall

Maidens and Mulan: [Mulan taking the parasol from Fal Li and running to fall
in line with the other 4 maidens]
Scarier than the undertaker
We are meeting our 
matchmaker

All Townspeople:
Destiny
Guard our girls
And our future 
as it fast unfurls
Please look kindly on 
these cultured pearls
Each a perfect porcelain doll

Maiden #1:  Please bring honor to us
Maiden #2:  Please bring honor to us
Maiden #3:  Please bring honor to us
Maiden #4:  Please bring honor to us
Mulan and Maidens:  Please bring honor to us all! 

[All Girls and Mulan arrive before the Matchmaker crouched down behind their
parasols.  End of song]

Matchmaker [looking at her clipboard]:  Fa Mulan

Mulan [Jumping up and raising her hand]:  Present.

Matchmaker:  Speaking without permission.

Mulan:  Oops. 

Grandma Fa [to Fa Li]:  Who spit in her bean curd?

[Mulan walks into the Matchmaker's building with the Matchmaker following
behind and closing the door]

Matchmaker [looking over Mulan]: Huh, Hmm, too skinny.  [Cri-Kee escapes from
his cage.  Mulan struggles to catch him] Hmph, not good for bearing sons. 
[Mulan puts Cri-Kee in her mouth when Matchmaker turns around to face her]
Recite the final admonition.

Mulan [nodding and smiling]:  Mmm-Hmm.  [Takes out fan and covers her mouth as
she spits out Cri-Kee] Ptu

Matchmaker:  Well...

Mulan [with dignity]: Fulfill your duties calmly and re...f--[looking at her
arm with smeared writing] spectfully.  Reflect before you snack [surprised,
Mulan looks at her arm again] act.  [now rapidly] This shall bring you honor
and glory.  [Fanning herself rapidly and sighing in relief] Huh.

Matchmaker [snatches the fan and looks at it on both sides looking for notes
not finding any.  Mulan smiles big when Matchmaker looks at her.  Matchmaker
grabs Mulan's right arm pulling her along while smearing the writing and
leaving some ink on her hand]  Hmmm, this way.  Now, pour the tea  [Pushing a
teapot towards Mulan].  To please your future in-laws you must demonstrate a
sense of dignity [Matchmaker smears ink around her mouth.  Mulan staring at
Matchmaker pours some tea onto the table then notices her mistake and pours
the tea into the cup] and refinement.  You must also be poised.  [Mulan
notices Cri-kee in the tea-cup as Matchmaker takes the cup]

Mulan [quiet and timid]:  Um, pardon me.

Matchmaker:  And silent! [Matchmaker sniffs the tea]

Mulan [reaching and grabbing the teacup]:  Could I just take that back...one
moment.

[They struggle for the teacup and it turns over on Matchmaker and Cri-kee
jumps down matchmaker's dress]

Matchmaker:  Why you clumsy--[Matchmaker feels Cri-Kee in her dress and dances
around]  Wooo, woooo, wooooooo, [Matchmaker knocks over her pot of coals, and
sits down on the coals.  Matchmaker jumps around screaming]  Ahhhhhhhhhhh 
[Mulan grabs her fan and briskly fans the charred area on Matchmaker's behind
causing it to flame up.  Mulan looks surprised about her mistake]

[Cut to outside Matchmakers building showing Grandma Fa with much noise coming
from Matchmaker's building]

Grandma Fa [to Fa Li]:  I think it's going well, don't you?

Matchmaker [running out of the building screaming]:  Put it out! Put it out! 
Put it out! [Mulan takes the teapot, throws the tea on Matchmaker and puts out
the fire.  She bows, hands the teapot back to Matchmaker and covers her face
as she walks toward Fa Li and Grandma Fa] [with anger]  You are a disgrace! 
[Matchmaker throws the teapot down smashing it to pieces]  You may look like a
bride, but you will never bring your family honor!

[The townsfolk who have gathered whisper and walk away]

[Cut to Mulan walking through the gate with her home leading khan.  She looks
sorrowful.  Fa Zhou sees his daughter and smiles.  Mulan sees her father's
smile.  She covers her face with Khan's head and leads him to the water
trough]

[Song: Reflection]

Mulan: 
Look at me [looking at her reflection in the water trough]
I will never pass for 
a perfect bride [taking off her earrings and beads of jade]
Or a perfect daughter [Mulan watches Fa Li relating what happened at the
Matchmaker's to Fa Zhou]
Can it be
I'm not meant to play 
this part?  [Mulan releases Cri-Kee back to the wild]
Now I see
That if I were to truly
To be myself [Mulan hops along the bridge railing]
I would break my 
family's heart

Who is that girl I see  [Mulan looks into the pond and sees her own
reflection]
Staring straight
Back at me? [Mulan puts her hand on the Great Stone Dragon and looks toward
the temple]
Why is my reflection someone 
I don't know? [Cri-Kee rowing across the pond on a lily pad]
Somehow I cannot hide [Mulan walking into the family temple]
Who I am [Cri-Kee watches Mulan in the temple seeing multiple reflections of
herself in the ancestors' stones]
Though I've tried  [Mulan bows to the ancestors]
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?  [Mulan finishes wiping off her make-up seeing her reflection
in the stones]
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside? [Mulan gets up and heads out the temple]

[End of song.  Mulan sits on a bench under the blossom tree.  Fa Zhou
approaches her, clearing his throat.  Mulan sees him approaching and turns her
head away.  Fa Zhou sits down beside Mulan]

Fa Zhou:  My, my, what beautiful blossoms we have this year [looking up into
the blossom tree].  But look, this one's late.  But, I'll bet that when it
blooms, it will be the most beautiful of all.  [Mulan and Fa Zhou share
smiles.  Drums start pounding announcing the arrival of Chi Fu and two guards
on horseback]

Mulan:  What is it?

[Fa Zhou gets up and walks to the entrance of their house with Mulan
following]

Fa Li:  Mulan, stay inside.

[Grandma Fa clears her throat catching Mulan's attention and motions inside. 
Mulan spies the railing near the wall and climbs up to watch over the roof]

Chi Fu:  Citizens  I bring you a proclamation from the Imperial City:  the
Huns have invaded China! 

Townspeople [expressing surprise]:  No!

Chi Fu:  By order of the Emperor, one man from every family must serve in the
Imperial Army.  The Xiao family [a family member steps up, bows to the guard
and takes the conscription notice from the guard].  The Yi family.

Yi's Son [holding his old father back]:  I will serve the Emperor in my
father's place.

Chi Fu:  The Fa Family.

Mulan:  No.

[Fa Zhou gives his cane to Fa Li and walks toward Chi Fu.  Fa Zhou bows before
the horsemen]

Fa Zhou [standing proud]:  I am ready to serve the Emperor.  [Fa Zhou reaches
for the conscription notice]

Mulan [running outside to keep her father from taking the conscription
notice]:  Father, you can't go.

Fa Zhou [turning to see his daughter]:  Mulan!

Mulan:  Please sir, my father has already fought bravely--

Chi Fu:  Silence!  You would do well to teach your daughter to hold her tongue
in a man's presence.

Fa Zhou [looking away from Mulan]:  Mulan, you dishonor me.

[Grandma Fa guides Mulan back away]

Chi Fu [handing Fa Zhou the conscription notice]:  Report tomorrow at the Wu
Shu camp.

Fa Zhou:  Yes, sir. [Fa Zhou walks back into the homestead refusing to take
his cane from Fa Li]

Chi Fu [fading out as we follow Fa Zhou]:  The Chu family.  The Wen family. 
The Chang family.  The...

[Cut to Fa Zhou in his armory at night.  Fa Zhou takes out his sword and
practices his stances.  Whan he balances on his right leg, his leg injury acts
up and he falls.  Unbeknownst to her father, Mulan watches in horror.  She
breathes heavily]

[Cut to dinner.  The Fa Zhou, Grandma Fa, Fa Li, and Mulan eat in silence. 
Thunder can be heard and lightning can be seen through the opaque window. 
Mulan pours the tea for her family.  She slams her teacup down on the table
and stands up]

Mulan:  You shouldn't have to go.

Fa Li:  Mulan!

Mulan:  There are plenty of young men to fight for China.

Fa Zhou:  It is an honor to protect my country and my family.

Mulan [angrily]:  So you'll die for honor!

Fa Zhou [standing up and angered]:  I will DIE doing what's right.

Mulan [starts to speak but is cut off]: But if you--

Fa Zhou:  I know my place, it is time you learned yours.

[Mulan looking like she's about to cry, turn away from Fa Zhou and runs
outside into the rain storm and cries]

[Cut to Mulan sitting at the base of the Great Stone Dragon in the rain. 
Mulan looks down to see her reflection in the puddle caused by the rain. She
watches her parents in the bedroom.  Fa Li turns away from Fa Zhou and walks
out of site.  Fa Zhou blows out the light.  Mulan gets up and walks to the Fa
Family Temple.  Mulan's image reflects off the stone tablets as she lights
incense and places it in the hanging encense holder.  She bows and prays to
her ancestors. Getting up, Mulan hurries down the steps.  Cri-Kee sees her and
hops down from above and follows her.  Mulan goes to her parent's bedroom and
takes the conscription notice replacing it with the hair comb her mother gave
to her.  She pauses to give her parents a loving, sorrowful look and hurries
out.  Cut to Mulan in the armory.  She opens the cabinet with the armor. 
Using her father's sword, she cuts her hair short and ties it up above her
head.  She finishes putting on the armor and ties it in the front.  She takes
the sword and places it in the scabbard to her left.  Cut to Mulan in the
stable doorway.  Khan rears back in fright at the sight of Mulan.  Mulan goes
forward and comforts Khan letting him know her identity.  Mulan walks Khan out
of the stable, Cri-Kee watches from the ground as she passes by.  Mulan takes
one sorrowful glance back at her parents bedroom and rides Khan through the
gate and off to camp.]

[Cut to the face of a statue in the Fa Family Temple.  The eyes glow.  Cut to
Grandma Fa.  She wakes up with a start rising in bed.  Cut to Grandma Fa
walking into Fa Li and Fa Zhou's bedroom, both are in bed]

Grandma Fa:  Mulan is gone.

Fa Zhou [waking up]:  What?  It can't be.  [Fa Zhou looks at his night stand
and notices the hair comb in place of his conscription notice.  He checks the
cabinet and sees his armor is gone.  He hurries outside] [calling out]  Mulan! 
[He stumbles while walking because of his leg injury] No.

Fa Li [kneeling down beside the fallen Fa Zhou]:  You must go after her.  She
could be killed!

Fa Zhou [sadly]:  If I reveal her, she will be. [Fa Zhou embraces Fa Li]

Grandma Fa:  Ancestors, hear our prayer: Watch over Mulan.

[Cut to the Fa Family Temple.  A wind blows out the incense at the base of the
center stone.  The center stone begins to glow as First Ancestor comes to
life]

First Ancestor [motioning to a bronze dragon]:  Mushu, awaken!

[Mushu comes to life and falls to the ground flat on his back all being
obscured by smoke]

Mushu [rising from the smoke arms stretched out]:  I live!  So tell me what
mortal needs my protection Great Ancestor.  You just say the word and I'm
there.

First Ancestor [agitated]:  Mushu!

Mushu:  Hey, let me say something. Anybody who is foolish enough to threaten
our family, vengeance will be MINE.  Hrrrrr.

First Ancestor [sternly to silence Mushu]:  Mushu!  These are the family
guardians [motioning towards the stone statues on pedestals near the ceiling]. 
They...

Mushu [dejectedly]:  Protect the family.

First Ancestor [pointing to the empty pedestal]:  And you, oh demoted one.

Mushu:  I...ring the gong.

First Ancestor:  That's right, now, wake up the ancestors.

Mushu:  One family reunion coming right up.  [ringing the gong] Okay people,
people look alive, lets go! C'mon get up.  Let's move it, rise and shine. 
You're way past the beauty sleep thing now trust me!

Ancestor 1:  I knew it, I knew it. That Mulan was a trouble maker from the
start.

Ancestor 3:  Don't look at me, she gets it from your side of the family.

Ancestor 2:  She's just trying to help her father.

Ancestor 4 [appearing out of thin air]:  But, if she is discovered, Fa Zhou
will be forever shamed.  Dishonor will come to the family.  Traditional values
will disintegrate.

Ancestor 5:  Not to mention they'll lose the farm.

Ancestor 1:  My children never caused such trouble.  They all became
acupuncturists.

Ancestor 3:  Well, We can't all be acupuncturists.

Ancestor 6:  No, your great granddaughter had to be cross-dresser!

[All ancestors argue at once, except First Ancestor]

Ancestor 7:  Let a guardian bring her back.  

Ancestor 8 [grabbing Mushu and bringing him next to a guardian]: Yeah, awaken
the most cunning.

Ancestor 4 [taking Mushu and holding him next to the stone rabbit guardian]: 
No, the swiftest.

Ancestor 9 [grabbing Mushu and holding him next to the stone monkey guardian]: 
No, send the wisest.

First Ancestor:  Silence!  We must send the most powerful of all [Motioning to
the Great Stone Dragon as it is seen through the window]

Mushu [climbs up the empty guardian post laughing]:  Ho, ho, heh, heh. Okay,
okay, I get the drift, I'll go. [All Ancestors give a quick look of surprise
and laugh uncontrollably]  You all don't think I can do it.  Watch this here. 
[Mushu produces a small flame from his mouth]  Ah, ha, Jump back, I'm pretty
hot huh.  Don't make me have to singe nobody to prove no point.

First Ancestor [grabbing Mushu and pulling away from the post]:  You had your
chance to protect the Fa family.

Ancestor 6:  Your mis-guidance led Fa Deng to disaster.

Fa Deng [with his decapitated head on his lap]:  Yeah, thanks a lot.

Mushu:  And your point is?

First Ancestor:  The point is we will be sending a real dragon to retrieve
Mulan.

Mushu:  What?  But I'm a real dragon.

First Ancestor [grabbing Mushu and pulling him away from the guardian post as
Mushu fights to hold on]:  You are not worthy of this spot.  Now, awaken the
Great Stone Dragon.  [First Ancestor throws Mushu out of the temple]

Mushu [looking back into the temple]:  So you'll get back to me on the job
thing.

[An ancestor throws Mushu's gong and hits Mushu in the face]

Mushu [walking with a slouch and banging the gong on the ground]:  Just one
chance is that too much to ask?  I mean, it's not like it'll kill ya.

Mushu [rings the gong and looks at the Great Stone Dragon]:  Yo rocky, wake
up!  You gotta go fetch Mulan.  [pauses as nothing happens.  Mushu walks over
to the side of the statue] C'mon boy, go get her, go on, [throws the gong
stick off the screen and whistles] Come on.  [Angrily while climbing up the
Great Stone Dragon] Grrr, Grrrr.  [speaking in his ear and banging the ear
with the gong] Hello, helloooooo. [curtly] Hello [bangs the gong extra hard
against the ear causing it to break off].  Uh oh.  [The Great Stone Dragon
crumbles to the ground, head intact minus the ear].  [knocks on the dragon's
head] Uh, Stoney, Stooooneeey.  Oh man, they're gonna kill me!

First Ancestor [calling out through the temple window]:  Great Stone Dragon,
have you awaken? 

Mushu [holding the head of the Great Stone Dragon up to that First Ancestor
can only see it's head and Mushu's body]:  Uhhh, Yes, I just woke up.  And I
am the Great Stone Dragon, good morning [Mushu waves].  I will go forth and
fetch Mulan.  Did, did I mention that I was the Great Stone Dragon?

First Ancestor:  Go, The fate of the Fa Family rests in your claws.

Mushu:  Don't even worry about it, I will not lose face.  [Mushu falls down
the hill under the weight of the Great Stone Dragon's head and lands on the
dragon's pedestal with the head falling on top of him]

Mushu [muffled]:  Ow, my elbow.  Aw, aw, I know I twisted something. 
[Throwing the head off him]  That's just great.  Now what?  I'm doomed!   And
all 'cause miss man decides to take her little drag show on the road.

[Cri-Kee enters stage right]

Cri-Kee:  Chirp, Chirp.

Mushu:  Go get her?   What's the matter with you?  After this great stone
Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd have to bring her home with a medal to get back in the
temple.  Wait a minute, that's it!  I make Mulan a war hero, then they'll be
begging me to come back to work.  That's the master plan.  Oh, you've gone and
done it now. [Mushu runs off stage right]

Cri-Kee [hopping along side of Mushu]:  Chirp.  Chirp Chirp Chirp.

Mushu [pushing Cri-Kee away]:  Hey, what makes you think you're coming?

Cri-Kee:  Chirp, Chirp. 

Mushu:  You're lucky?  Ho, ho, heh.  Do I look like a sucker to you?

Cri-Kee:  Chirp. Chirp.

Mushu:  Whach' you mean loser?  How 'bout I pop one of your antenna's off and
throw it across the yard.  Then who's a loser, me or you?

[Interlude]

[Cut to Shan-Yu leading his army at a charge on horseback through a forest. 
He stops and motions stage right.  Hun Archer, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Long-Hair
Guy dismount and walk into the forest.  They throw down two Imperial scouts
before the rest of the army]

Hun Long-Hair Guy:  Imperial scouts. 

[Shan Yu dismounts and walks towards the scouts]

Scout #1:  Shan-Yu.

[He crouches down in front of them]

Shan-Yu [adjusting Scout #1's collar]:  Nice work, gentlemen.  You found the
Hun army. [motioning to the soldiers on horseback.  The Hun army laughs]

Scout #2:  The Emperor will stop you.

Shan-Yu [grabs Scout #2 by the shirt collar and lifts him up to his face]: 
Stop me?  He invited me.  By building his wall, he challenged my strength. 
Well I'm here to play his game  [Shan-Yu throws Scout #2 to the ground and
points his sword at Scout #1 as he gets up and runs] [calling out to the
scouts] Go!  Tell your emperor to send his strongest armies.  [Quietly]  I'm
ready. 

[The Imperial Scouts run off towards the palace]

Shan-Yu [scratching his chin]:  How many men does it take to deliver a
message.

Archer Guy [drawing back his bow]:  One.

[End Interlude]

[Cut to Mulan on a hill outside of the camp.  Khan is sitting watching]

Mulan:  Okay, okay, how 'bout this?  Ahem, [in her manly voice] excuse me,
where do I sign in?  Hah, I see you have a sword.  I have one too.  They're
very manly and tough [Mulan bites her lip as she mishandles pulling the sword
out of the scabbard and it falls to the ground.  Khan rolls on his back in
laughter.  Mulan throws her shoe and hits Khan in the head with it quieting
Khan].  I'm working on it.  Who am I fooling?  It's going to take a miracle to
get me into the army.

[Mushu appears as a giant shadow being cast on a rock with flames on either
side.  Mushu's real appearance remains out of sight]

Mushu [in a Southern Baptist Preacher's voice]:  Did I hear someone ask for a
miracle!?  Let me hear you say aye!

Mulan [Running and hiding behind a rock]:  Ahhhhhh.

Mushu:  That's close enough.

Mulan [from behind a rock]:  Ghost.

Mushu:  Get ready Mulan your serpentine salvation is at hand.  For I have
been sent by your ancestors-- [notices Cri-Kee making a hand shadow of a
dragon on the rock and stamps him down with his foot] to guide you through
your masquerade.  [bending down to Cri-Kee]  C'mon, you're gonna stay you're
gonna work. [returning to Mulan] Heed my word, 'cause if the army finds out
that you are a girl, the penalty is death. [big flames shoot up from the
rocks]

Mulan:  Who are you?

Mushu:  Who am I?  Who am I?  I am the guardian of lost souls. [Mulan smiles
big in anticipation of seeing her guardian] I am the powerful, the
pleasurable, the indestructible [coming out from the rocks to show his real
size] Mushu! Oh hah, hah, pretty hot, huh? [Khan stomps on Mushu.  Mulan
pushes Khan back]

Mulan:  Ah, my ancestors sent a little lizard to help me?

Mushu:  Hey, dragon, dragon,  not lizard.  I don't do that tongue thing [flips
out his tongue to show Mulan what he means].

Mulan:  You're uh...

Mushu:  Intimidating?  Awe inspiring?

Mulan [making a hand gesture to denote his smallness of size]: Tiny.

Mushu [with a look of disappointment]:  Of course.  I'm travel size for your
convenience.  If I was my real size, your cow here [patting Khan on the nose]
would die of fright.  [Khan tries to bite Mushu]  [pointing to the ground
speaking to Khan] Down Bessy.  My powers are beyond your mortal imagination. 
For instance, [leaning in and looking at Mulan's chest] my eyes can see
straight through your armor.  [Mulan cover her bust with her left arm and
slaps Mushu with the right]  Ow.  [angrily] All right, that's it!  Dishonor! 
Dishonor on your whole family.  [aside to Cri-Kee] Make a note of this
[Cri-Kee grabs a leaf and a pen and starts writing].  [Loudly with gusto]
Dishonor on you.  Dishonor on your cow.  Dis-

Mulan [pleadingly while covering Mushu's mouth]:  Stop!  I'm sorry, I'm sorry
[kneeling down in front of Mushu].  I'm just nervous.  I've never done this
before.

Mushu: Then you're gonna have to trust me.  And don't you slap me no more, we
clear on that?  [Mulan nods emphatically].  All right.  Okey dokey, let's get
this show on the road.  Cri-Kee, get the bags [Mushu starts walking to the
camp].  [to Khan] Let's move it heifer.

[Cut to Mulan at the camp's entrance]

Mushu [hiding in Mulan's armor poking his head out from her back]:  Okay this
is it, time to show 'em your man walk.  Shoulders back,  chest high, feet
apart, head up [Mushu pulls Mulan's head back]  ...and strut 2, 3, break it
down, 2, 3 and work it, [Mulan walks into the camp drawing the attention the
men who see her.  Mulan walks into a tent and sees a man picking his nose and
another man picking out dirt from between his toes with chopsticks] Beautiful
isn't it?

Mulan [making a face of disgust and continuing to walk]:  They're disgusting.

Mushu:  No, they're men.  And you're going to have to act just like them, so
pay attention.

[Mulan stops and watches Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and Tattoo Soldier]

Tattoo Soldier [showing the dragon tattoo on his chest and belly]:  Look, this
tattoo will protect me from harm.

[Yao thinks for a moment, then punches Tattoo Soldier in the stomach causing
Ling to laugh.  Mulan watches in utter amazement.  Yao kisses his hand]

Ling [laughing]:  I hope you can get your money back.

Mulan:  I don't think I can do this.

Mushu:  It's all attitude.  Be tough like this guy here [looking at Yao].

[Mulan looks at Yao as he hocks up a loogie and spits]

Yao [noticing Mulan watching him]:  What are you looking at?

Mushu:  Punch him, it's how men say 'hello.'

[Mulan looks at her fist, then punches Yao from behind on the shoulder.  The
force causes Yao to run into Chien-Po]

Chien-Po:  Oh Yao, you made a friend.

Mushu:  Good, Now slap him on the behind, they like that.

[Mulan slaps Yao on the behind]

Yao:  Wu hoo hooooo.  [grabbing Mulan buy the collar]  I'm going to hit you so
hard it'll make your ancestors dizzy.

Chien-Po [Holding and picking up Yao]:  Yao, relax and chant with me. 
Yaaaaaaa Moouuuu Ahhhhhh Doooou Fuuuu Daaaaa.
 
Yao:  Ya Mi Ah To Fu Da.

Chien-Po:  Feel better? 

Yao [relaxed]:  Yeah. [Chien-Po places Yao back on the ground]  [to Mulan
while walking away] Aaaaa, you ain't worth my time chicken boy.

Mushu [loudly]:  Chicken boy!?  Say that to my face ya limp noodle!

[Yao grabs Mulan by the collar cocking back his arm to punch.  Mulan ducks as
Yao hits Ling standing behind her]

Yao:  Oh, sorry Ling.  Hey!

[Yao grabs Mulan's foot as she starts to crawl away.  Ling kicks Yao on the butt causing him to land on Chien-Po's stomach. Ling Jump
attacks Mulan, but she ducks and he lands on Yao on top of Chien-Po]

Ling:  You're dead.  [They fight on top of Chien-Po.  Mulan runs away.  Ling notices Mulan and then points toward her] Oh, there he goes.

[Mulan runs into a tent and stops.  Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (in that order) run through the tent.  Yao stops short as he is about to run into a
soldier in a line for food.  He looks behind him with concerned eyes as Ling stops in time.  Chien-Po bumps into Ling causing the entire line
of soldiers to fall forward and knock over the pot of congee and the cook behind it.  The men look to the back of the line and spy Mulan"

[entering graveyard] 

	Jack's Lament
	Performed by Danny Elfman

There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night

I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known

I'm the master of fright, and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France

And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could

Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears

[leaving graveyard and entering forest]

SALLY
Jack, I know how you feel.  

[Sally gathers herbs]

[back at Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Sally, you've come back.

SALLY
I had to.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
For this?

[showing her arm]

SALLY
Yes.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Shall we then.
That's twice this month you've slipped deadly nightshade into my tea
 and run off --

SALLY
Three times!

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You're mine you know!  I made you with my own hands.

SALLY
You can make other creations.  I'm restless, I can't help it.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
It's a phase my dear, it'll pass.  We need to be patient that's all.

SALLY
But, I don't want to be patient.

Whoa!!!!

	What's This?
	Performed by Danny Elfman

What's this? What's this?
There's color everywhere
What's this?
There's white things in the air
What's this?
I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this?
What's this? What's this?
There's something very wrong
What's this?
There's people singing songs

What's this?
The streets are lined with
Little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy?
What is this? 
What's this?

There's children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead

There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside

Oh, look
What's this?
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this?

What's this?
In here they've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why?

They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun
This looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish?
What's this?

Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things
Secure inside their dreamland
What's this?

The monsters are all missing
And the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be
Good feeling all around

Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere

The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough

I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found?
What is this?
Christmas Town, hmm...

SANDY CLAWS
Ho Ho Ho Ho ho ho ho ho

JACK
hmm..

SALLY
Frog's breath will overpower any odor.  Bitter.  [coughing]  Worm's 
wart.  Where's that worm's wart?

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Sally, that soup ready yet?

SALLY
Coming....lunch

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Ah, what's that?  Worm's wart, mmm, and...frog's breath.

SALLY
What's wrong?  I-I thought you liked frog's breath.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Nothing's more suspicious than frog's breath. Until you taste it I won't 
swallow a spoonful.

SALLY
I'm not hungry... [knocking spoon]  Oops!

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You want me to starve.  An old man like me who hardly has strength as it 
is.  Me, to whom you owe your very life.

SALLY
Oh don't be silly.  [eats soup with trick spoon]  Mmmm, see.  Scrumptious.

[Dr. Finkelstein eats soup]

Immediately!

[in his mayor truck]
Town meeting, town meeting, town meeting tonight, town meeting tonight

[at meeting]

Clown
[giggles as he hits Sally]

JACK
Listen everyone.  I want to tell you about Christmastown.

	Town Meeting Song
	Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast

JACK
There are objects so peculiar
They were not to be believed
All around, things to tantalize my brain
It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen
And as hard as I try
I can't seem to describe
Like a most improbable dream
But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist
Here, let me show you

This is a thing called a present
The whole thing starts with a box

DEVIL
A box?
is it steel?

WEREWOLF
Are there locks?

HARLEOUIN DEMON
Is it filled with a pox?

DEVIL, WEREWOLF, HARLEQUIN DEMON
A pox
How delightful, a pox

JACK
If you please
Just a box with bright-colored paper
And the whole thing's topped with a bow

WITCHES
A bow?
But why?
How ugly
What's in it?
What's in it?

JACK
That's the point of the thing, not to know

CLOWN
It's a bat
Will it bend?

CREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS
It's a rat
Will it break?

UNDERSEA GAL
Perhaps it s the head that I found in the lake

JACK
Listen now, you don't understand
That's not the point of Christmas land

Now, pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock
And hang it like this on the wall

MR. HYDE
Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot?

MEDIUM MR. HYDE
Let me see, let me look

SMALL MR. HYDE
Is it rotted and covered with gook?

JACK
Um, let me explain
There's no foot inside, but there's candy
Or sometimes it's filled with small toys

MUMMY AND WINGED DEMON
Small toys

WINGED DEMON
Do they bite?

MUMMY
Do they snap?

WINGED DEMON
Or explode in a sack?

CORPSE KID
Or perhaps they just spring out
And scare girls and boys

MAYOR
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun
I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once

JACK
Everyone, please now, not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
Well, I may as well give them what they want
And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmas land
Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
Least that's what I've come to understand

And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold
Like a lobster, huge and red
When he sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is, so I've heard it said

And on a dark, cold night
Under full moonlight
He flies into a fog
Like a vulture in the sky
And they call him Sandy Claws

Well, at least they're excited
But they don't understand
That special kind of feeling in Christmas land
Oh, well...

[Jack's house]

JACK
There's got to be a logical way to explain this Xmas thing.

[Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You've poisoned me for the last time you wretched girl.

[locks Sally away]

[dingdong]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Oh my head...the door is open.

JACK
Hel-lo

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Jack Skellington, up here my boy.

JACK
Dr. I need to borrow some equipment.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Is that so, whatever for?

JACK
I'm conducting a series of experiments.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
How perfectly marvelous.  Curiosity killed the cat, you know.

JACK
I know.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Come on into the lab and we'll get you all fixed up.

SALLY
Hmm.  Experiments?

[Jack's house]

JACK
Zero, I'm home.

[Jack examines & experiments with Xmas stuff]

JACK
Interesting reaction....but what does it mean?

[Sally's room]

[after Sally jumps to give Jack his basket...]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You can come out now if you promise to behave.  Sally.  Sally.  Oooh!  Gone 
again!

catches on fire]

	Jack's Obsession
	Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast

CITIZENS OF HALLOWEEN
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack
Don't know if we're ever going to get him back

He's all alone up there
Locked away inside
Never says a word
Hope he hasn't died
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

JACK
Christmas time is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be? I cannot tell
There's so many things I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it, and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip

Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try, I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in an instant, gone in a flash
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's there I cannot see
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Hmm...

I've read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols all by heart
My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart
As often as I've read them, something's wrong
So hard to put my bony finger on

Or perhaps it's really not as deep
As I've been led to think
Am I trying much too hard?
Of course! I've been too close to see
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me

It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible, but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it
 
You know, I think this Christmas thing
It's not as tricky as it seems
And why should they have all the fun?
It should belong to anyone

Not anyone, in fact, but me
Why, I could make a Christmas tree
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmas time

I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do
Hee,hee,hee

JACK
Eureka!!  This year, Christmas will be ours!

MAYOR
Patience, everyone.  Jack has a special Job for each of us.  Dr. 
Finkelstein, your Xmas assignment is ready.  Dr. Finkelstein to the front

JACK
Perhaps it can be improved?

VAMPIRES
No problem!

JACK
I knew it!  Dr. thank you for coming.  We need some of these.

La, la, la, la, la

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights

SHOCK
First, we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate

LOCK
Wait! I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks

SHOCK
Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare

LOCK,SHOCK, AND BARREL
Wheeee

LOCK
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door
And then knock three times
And when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

SHOCK
You're so stupid, think now
lf we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And then Jack will beat us black and green

LOCK,SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then, see if he is sad

LOCK AND SHOCK
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
If I were on his Boogie list, I'd get out of town

BARREL
He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I'll bet

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew
Ummm!

We're his little henchmen and
We take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

SHOCK
I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb

BARREL
I'm not the dumb one

LOCK
You're no fun

SHOCK
Shut up

LOCK
Make me

SHOCK
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide
Until his curiosity entices him to look inside

BARREL
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, beat him with a stick
Lock him up for ninety years, see what makes him tick
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then, throw away the key

OOGIE BOOGIE
Sandy Claws..hahaha

[city hall]

JACK
It goes something like this.  [Jingle bells]
How about it?  Think you can manage?

PERSON INSIDE BASS
a one, and a two, and a three, and a. . . 

[Jingle in a flat key by the band]

MAYOR
Next!

JACK
Fantastic!  Now why don't you all practice on that and we'll be in great 
shape.  Sally, I need your help more than anyone's.  

SALLY
You certainly do, Jack.  I had the most terrible vision.

JACK
That's splendid.

SALLY
No, it was about your Xmas.  There was smoke and fire.

JACK
That not my Xmas.  My Xmas is filled with laughter and joy and this--my 
Sandy Claws outfit.  I want you to make it.

SALLY
Jack, please, listen to me--it's going to be a disaster.

JACK
How could it be--just follow the pattern.  This part is red, the trim is 
white.

SALLY
It's a mistake, Jack.

JACK
Now don't be modest, who else is clever enough to make my Sandy claws outfit.

MAYOR
Next!

JACK
I have every confidence in you.

SALLY
But it seems wrong to me, very wrong.

[to Behemoth]

JACK
This device is called a nutcracker.

LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
Jack, Jack we caught him we caught him.

JACK
Perfect!  Open it up.  Quickly!

[opens to reveal the Easter bunny]

JACK
That's not Sandy Claws!

SHOCK
It isn't?

BARREL
Who is it?

BEHEMOTH
Bunny!

JACK
Not Sandy Claws...take him back!

LOCK
We followed your instructions--

BARREL
we went through the door--

JACK
Which door?  There's more than one.  Sandy Claws is behind the door 
shaped like this.  

[shows Xmas cookie in shape of tree]

SHOCK
I told you!

[LS&B start fighting]

JACK
Arr!!  [making scary face at LS&B]

JACK
I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir.  Take him home first  and 
apologize again.  Be careful with Sandy Claws when you fetch him.  Treat 
him nicely.

LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
Got it.  We'll get it right next time.

[Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally.

IGOR
Master, the plans.

SALLY
You don't look like yourself Jack, not at all.

JACK
Isn't that wonderful.  It couldn't be more wonderful!

SALLY
But you're the Pumpkin King.

JACK
Not anymore.  And I feel so much better now.

SALLY
Jack, I know you think something's missing.  But --

Sorry

Sandy Claws in person.  What a pleasure to meet you.  Why you have

SANDY CLAWS
Where am I?

JACK
Surprised aren't you?  I knew you would be.  You don't need to have 
another worry about Xmas this year.  

SANDY CLAWS
What?

JACK
Consider this a vacation Sandy,  a reward.  It's your turn to take it easy.

SANDY CLAWS
But there must be some mistake!

JACK
See that he's comfortable.  Just a second fellows.  Of course, that's 
what I'm missing.  

SANDY CLAWS
But --

JACK
Thanks!  [took Sandy's hat]

SANDY CLAWS
You just can't...  Hold on where are we going now?

This is worse than I thought, much worse.  I know...

SANDY CLAWS
Me?  On vacation on Xmas eve?

BARREL
Where are we taking him?

SALLY
Where?

LOCK
To Oogie boogie, of course.  There isn't anywhere in the whole world more 
comfortable than that and Jack said to make him comfortable.  Didn't he?

Yes he did.

Haven't you heard of peace on earth and good will toward men?

	Oogie Boogie's Song
	Performed by Ken Page with Ed lvory

OOGIE BOOGIE
Well, well, well, what have we here?
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oh, I'm really scared
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha

You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my eyes
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse
I might just split a seam now
If I don't die laughing first

Mr. Oogie Boogie says
There's trouble close at hand
You'd better pay attention now
'Cause I'm the Boogie Man
And if you aren't shakin'
There's something very wrong
'Cause this may be the last time
You hear the boogie song, ohhh

THREE SKELETONS
Ohhh

OOGIE BOOGIE
Ohhh

TWO SKELETONS IN VICE

OOGIE BOOGIE

Ohhh, he's the Oogie Boogie Man

SANTA
Release me now
Or you must face the dire consequences
The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses

OOGIE BOOGIE
You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my ears
Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears
It's funny, I'm laughing
You really are too much
And now, with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff

SANTA
What are you going to do?

OOGIE BOOGIE
I'm gonna do the best I can

Oh, the sound of rollin' dice
To me is music in the air
'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man
Although I don't play fair

It's much more fun, I must confess
With lives on the line
Not mine, of course, but yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine

SANTA
Release me fast or you will have to
Answer for this heinous act

OOGIE BOOGIE
Oh, brother, you're something
You put me in a spin
You aren't comprehending
The position that you're in
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer
'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie
And you ain't going nowhere

Good bye Jack, my dearest Jack.  Oh how I hope my premonition is wrong.

	Sally's Song
	Performed by Catherine O'Hara

I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend

And does he notice my feelings for him?
And will he see how much he means to me?
I think it's not to be

What will become of my dear friend?
Where will his actions lead us then?
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may, it doesn't last

And will we ever end up together?
No, I think not, it's never to become
For I am not the one

[entering graveyard] 

	Jack's Lament
	Performed by Danny Elfman

There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night

I excel without ever even trying
With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give out a shriek
With the wave of my hand, and a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year, it's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there, far from my home
A longing that I've never known

I'm the master of fright, and a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France

And since I am dead, I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown, if they only understood
He'd give it all up if he only could

Oh, there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears

[leaving graveyard and entering forest]

SALLY
Jack, I know how you feel.  

[Sally gathers herbs]

[back at Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Sally, you've come back.

SALLY
I had to.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
For this?

[showing her arm]

SALLY
Yes.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Shall we then.
That's twice this month you've slipped deadly nightshade into my tea
 and run off --

SALLY
Three times!

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You're mine you know!  I made you with my own hands.

SALLY
You can make other creations.  I'm restless, I can't help it.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
It's a phase my dear, it'll pass.  We need to be patient that's all.

SALLY
But, I don't want to be patient.

	What's This?
	Performed by Danny Elfman

What's this? What's this?
There's color everywhere
What's this?
There's white things in the air
What's this?
I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this?
What's this? What's this?
There's something very wrong
What's this?
There's people singing songs

What's this?
The streets are lined with
Little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy?
What is this? 
What's this?

There's children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead

There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside

Oh, look
What's this?
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this?

What's this?
In here they've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why?

They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun
This looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish?
What's this?

Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things
Secure inside their dreamland
What's this?

The monsters are all missing
And the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be
Good feeling all around

Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere

The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around
I've never felt so good before
This empty place inside of me is filling up
I simply cannot get enough

I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found?
What is this?
Christmas Town, hmm...

SANDY CLAWS
Ho Ho Ho Ho ho ho ho ho

Clown
I looked in every mausoleum.

WITCHES
We opened the sarcophagi.

Hyde
I tromped through the pumpkin patch.

VAMPIRE
I peeked behind the Cyclops's eye.  I did!  But he wasn't there.

MAYOR
It's time to sound the alarms.

[DR. FINKELSTEIN's castle]

SALLY
Frog's breath will overpower any odor.  Bitter.  [coughing]  Worm's 
wart.  Where's that worm's wart?

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Sally, that soup ready yet?

SALLY
Coming....lunch

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Ah, what's that?  Worm's wart, mmm, and...frog's breath.

SALLY
What's wrong?  I-I thought you liked frog's breath.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Nothing's more suspicious than frog's breath. Until you taste it I won't 
swallow a spoonful.

SALLY
I'm not hungry... [knocking spoon]  Oops!

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You want me to starve.  An old man like me who hardly has strength as it 
is.  Me, to whom you owe your very life.

SALLY
Oh don't be silly.  [eats soup with trick spoon]  Mmmm, see.  Scrumptious.

[Dr. Finkelstein eats soup] 

[Halloween]

MAYOR
Did anyone think to dredge the lake?

VAMPIRE
Ah, this morning!

ZERO
barks

Witch
Hear that?

Witch (little)
What?

Witch
Shh!

ZERO
barks

VAMPIRE
Zero!

[fanfare as Jack and Zero arrive]

Kid
Jack's back!

MAYOR
Where have you been?

JACK
Call a town meeting and I'll tell everyone all about it.

MAYOR
When?

JACK
Immediately!

MAYOR
[in his mayor truck]
Town meeting, town meeting, town meeting tonight, town meeting tonight

[at meeting]

Clown
[giggles as he hits Sally]

JACK
Listen everyone.  I want to tell you about Christmastown.

	Town Meeting Song
	Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast

JACK
There are objects so peculiar
They were not to be believed
All around, things to tantalize my brain
It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen
And as hard as I try
I can't seem to describe
Like a most improbable dream
But you must believe when I tell you this
It's as real as my skull and it does exist
Here, let me show you

This is a thing called a present
The whole thing starts with a box

DEVIL
A box?
is it steel?

WEREWOLF
Are there locks?

HARLEOUIN DEMON
Is it filled with a pox?

DEVIL, WEREWOLF, HARLEQUIN DEMON
A pox
How delightful, a pox

JACK
If you please
Just a box with bright-colored paper
And the whole thing's topped with a bow

WITCHES
A bow?
But why?
How ugly
What's in it?
What's in it?

JACK
That's the point of the thing, not to know

CLOWN
It's a bat
Will it bend?

CREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS
It's a rat
Will it break?

UNDERSEA GAL
Perhaps it s the head that I found in the lake

JACK
Listen now, you don't understand
That's not the point of Christmas land

Now, pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock
And hang it like this on the wall

MR. HYDE
Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot?

MEDIUM MR. HYDE
Let me see, let me look

SMALL MR. HYDE
Is it rotted and covered with gook?

JACK
Um, let me explain
There's no foot inside, but there's candy
Or sometimes it's filled with small toys

MUMMY AND WINGED DEMON
Small toys

WINGED DEMON
Do they bite?

MUMMY
Do they snap?

WINGED DEMON
Or explode in a sack?

CORPSE KID
Or perhaps they just spring out
And scare girls and boys

MAYOR
What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun
I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once

JACK
Everyone, please now, not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
Well, I may as well give them what they want
And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmas land
Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
Least that's what I've come to understand

And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold
Like a lobster, huge and red
When he sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is, so I've heard it said

And on a dark, cold night
Under full moonlight
He flies into a fog
Like a vulture in the sky
And they call him Sandy Claws

Well, at least they're excited
But they don't understand
That special kind of feeling in Christmas land
Oh, well...

[Jack's house]

JACK
There's got to be a logical way to explain this Xmas thing.

[Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You've poisoned me for the last time you wretched girl.

[locks Sally away]

[dingdong]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Oh my head...the door is open.

JACK
Hel-lo

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Jack Skellington, up here my boy.

JACK
Dr. I need to borrow some equipment.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Is that so, whatever for?

JACK
I'm conducting a series of experiments.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
How perfectly marvelous.  Curiosity killed the cat, you know.

JACK
I know.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Come on into the lab and we'll get you all fixed up.

SALLY
Hmm.  Experiments?

[Jack's house]

JACK
Zero, I'm home.

[Jack examines & experiments with Xmas stuff]

JACK
Interesting reaction....but what does it mean?

[Sally's room]

[after Sally jumps to give Jack his basket...]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You can come out now if you promise to behave.  Sally.  Sally.  Oooh!  Gone 
again!

[Jack's house]

[Sally gives Jack his basket and sneaks off and picks a flower which 
catches on fire]

	Jack's Obsession
	Performed by Danny Elfman and Cast

CITIZENS OF HALLOWEEN
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack
Don't know if we're ever going to get him back

He's all alone up there
Locked away inside
Never says a word
Hope he hasn't died
Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack

JACK
Christmas time is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be? I cannot tell
There's so many things I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it, and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip

Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try, I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in an instant, gone in a flash
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though

Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's there I cannot see
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Hmm...

I've read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols all by heart
My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart
As often as I've read them, something's wrong
So hard to put my bony finger on

Or perhaps it's really not as deep
As I've been led to think
Am I trying much too hard?
Of course! I've been too close to see
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me

It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible, but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it
 
You know, I think this Christmas thing
It's not as tricky as it seems
And why should they have all the fun?
It should belong to anyone

Not anyone, in fact, but me
Why, I could make a Christmas tree
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmas time

I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do
Hee,hee,hee

JACK
Eureka!!  This year, Christmas will be ours!

MAYOR
Patience, everyone.  Jack has a special Job for each of us.  Dr. 
Finkelstein, your Xmas assignment is ready.  Dr. Finkelstein to the front 
of the line.

VAMPIRE
What kind of a noise is that for a baby to make?

JACK
Perhaps it can be improved?

VAMPIRES
No problem!

JACK
I knew it!  Dr. thank you for coming.  We need some of these.
[showing picture of Santa and sleigh]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Hmm.. their construction should be exceedingly simple.  I think.

MAYOR
How horrible our Xmas will be.

JACK
No--how jolly.

MAYOR
[switches face]
Oh, how jolly our Xmas will be.  [gets pelted]  What are you doing here?

Jack, Jack it's Oogie's boys!

JACK
Ah, Halloween's finest trick or treaters.  The job I have for you is top 
secret.  It requires craft, cunning, mischief.

SHOCK
And we thought you didn't like us, Jack.
[giggles]

JACK
Absolutely no one is to know about it.  Not a soul.  Now--
[whispers to LS&B] 
And one more thing -- leave that no account Ooogie Boogie out of this!

BARREL
Whatever you say, Jack.

SHOCK
Of course Jack.

LOCK
Wouldn't dream of it Jack.

	Kidnap the Sandy Claws
	Performed by Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, and Danny Elfman

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws

LOCK
I wanna do it

BARREL
Let's draw straws

SHOCK
Jack said we should work together
Three of a kind

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Birds of a feather
Now and forever
Wheeee
La, la, la, la, la

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights

SHOCK
First, we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate

LOCK
Wait! I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks

SHOCK
Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased, I do declare
That he will cook him rare

LOCK,SHOCK, AND BARREL
Wheeee

LOCK
I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door
And then knock three times
And when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

SHOCK
You're so stupid, think now
lf we blow him up to smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And then Jack will beat us black and green

LOCK,SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then, see if he is sad

LOCK AND SHOCK
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
If I were on his Boogie list, I'd get out of town

BARREL
He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I'll bet

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew
Ummm!

We're his little henchmen and
We take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

SHOCK
I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb

BARREL
I'm not the dumb one

LOCK
You're no fun

SHOCK
Shut up

LOCK
Make me

SHOCK
I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide
Until his curiosity entices him to look inside

BARREL
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, beat him with a stick
Lock him up for ninety years, see what makes him tick
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then, throw away the key

OOGIE BOOGIE
Sandy Claws..hahaha

[city hall]

JACK
It goes something like this.  [Jingle bells]
How about it?  Think you can manage?

PERSON INSIDE BASS
a one, and a two, and a three, and a. . . 

[Jingle in a flat key by the band]

MAYOR
Next!

JACK
Fantastic!  Now why don't you all practice on that and we'll be in great 
shape.  Sally, I need your help more than anyone's.  

SALLY
You certainly do, Jack.  I had the most terrible vision.

JACK
That's splendid.

SALLY
No, it was about your Xmas.  There was smoke and fire.

JACK
That not my Xmas.  My Xmas is filled with laughter and joy and this--my 
Sandy Claws outfit.  I want you to make it.

SALLY
Jack, please, listen to me--it's going to be a disaster.

JACK
How could it be--just follow the pattern.  This part is red, the trim is 
white.

SALLY
It's a mistake, Jack.

JACK
Now don't be modest, who else is clever enough to make my Sandy claws outfit.

MAYOR
Next!

JACK
I have every confidence in you.

SALLY
But it seems wrong to me, very wrong.

[to Behemoth]

JACK
This device is called a nutcracker.

LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
Jack, Jack we caught him we caught him.

JACK
Perfect!  Open it up.  Quickly!

[opens to reveal the Easter bunny]

JACK
That's not Sandy Claws!

SHOCK
It isn't?

BARREL
Who is it?

BEHEMOTH
Bunny!

JACK
Not Sandy Claws...take him back!

LOCK
We followed your instructions--

BARREL
we went through the door--

JACK
Which door?  There's more than one.  Sandy Claws is behind the door 
shaped like this.  

[shows Xmas cookie in shape of tree]

SHOCK
I told you!

[LS&B start fighting]

JACK
Arr!!  [making scary face at LS&B]

JACK
I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir.  Take him home first  and 
apologize again.  Be careful with Sandy Claws when you fetch him.  Treat 
him nicely.

LOCK, SHOCK & BARREL
Got it.  We'll get it right next time.

[Dr. Finkelstein's castle]

DR. FINKELSTEIN
You will be a decided improvement over that treacherous Sally.

IGOR
Master, the plans.

DR. FINKELSTEIN
Excellent, Igor.

You don't look like yourself Jack, not at all.

Isn't that wonderful.  It couldn't be more wonderful!

But you're the Pumpkin King.

Not anymore.  And I feel so much better now.

SALLY
Jack, I know you think something's missing.  But --

Sorry

SANDY CLAWS
Where am I?

JACK
Surprised aren't you?  I knew you would be.  You don't need to have 
another worry about Xmas this year.  

SANDY CLAWS
What?

JACK
Consider this a vacation Sandy,  a reward.  It's your turn to take it easy.

SANDY CLAWS
But there must be some mistake!

JACK
See that he's comfortable.  Just a second fellows.  Of course, that's 
what I'm missing.

Oh, I'm really scared
So you're the one everybody's talkin' about, ha, ha

You're jokin', you're jokin'
I can't believe my eyes
You're jokin' me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy
He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse
I might just split a seam now
If I don't die laughing first

Mr. Oogie Boogie says
There's trouble close at hand
You'd better pay attention now
'Cause I'm the Boogie Man
And if you aren't shakin'
There's something very wrong
'Cause this may be the last time
You hear the boogie song, ohhh

And now, with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff

SANTA
What are you going to do?

OOGIE BOOGIE
I'm gonna do the best I can

Oh, the sound of rollin' dice
To me is music in the air
'Cause I'm a gamblin' Boogie Man
Although I don't play fair

It's much more fun, I must confess
With lives on the line
Not mine, of course, but yours, old boy
Now that'd be just fine

SANTA
Release me fast or you will have to
Answer for this heinous act

OOGIE BOOGIE
Oh, brother, you're something
You put me in a spin
You aren't comprehending
The position that you're in
It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer
'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie
And you ain't going nowhere

	Sally's Song
	Performed by Catherine O'Hara

I sense there's something in the wind
That feels like tragedy's at hand
And though I'd like to stand by him
Can't shake this feeling that I have
The worst is just around the bend

And does he notice my feelings for him?
And will he see how much he means to me?
I think it's not to be

What will become of my dear friend?
Where will his actions lead us then?
Although I'd like to join the crowd
In their enthusiastic cloud
Try as I may, it doesn't last

And will we ever end up together?
No, I think not, it's never to become
For I am not the one

30	ParaNorman 	Chris Butler	Animation,Adventure,Comedy	August_2012	"1 INT. RESEARCH LABORATORY - NIGHT 1

           An attractive FEMALE SCIENTIST in a gore-spattered lab
           coat moves fearfully along a wall, passing benches strewn
           with broken lab equipment. Her ample bosom heaves as she
           PANTS nervously, mascara-rimmed eyes darting to and fro.
           Glass SMASHES on the floor nearby and MELODRAMATIC MUSIC
           swells. The woman backs into a shadow, not noticing a
           pair of dead eyes catching the moonlight behind her.
           The music climbs to a frenzy as something GROANS horribly
           into the woman's ear. She spins around on her stiletto
           heels as a rotted face looms out of the darkness,
           drooling through broken teeth, and lunges at her neck.

                          ZOMBIE
           Brains!

           INT. BABCOCK'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Eleven year-old NORMAN BABCOCK sits on the floor
           watching TV. He has large piercing eyes and a messy shock
           of hair. The movie scene we just witnessed continues off-
           screen with the sound of bloodcurdling SCREAMS.
           Behind him sitting upon a sofa is GRANDMA BABCOCK, a
           plump old lady squinting through thick glasses.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           What's happening now?

                          NORMAN
           The zombie is eating her head,
           Grandma.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           That's not very nice. What's he
           doing that for?

                          NORMAN
           Because he's a zombie. That's what
           they do.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           Well he's going to ruin his
           dinner. I'm sure if they just
           bothered to sit down and talk it
           through it'd be a different story.
           Norman CHUCKLES, as if the idea is absurd, then winces as
           he hears his father shout from the kitchen.

           Norman! Didn't I tell you to take
           out the garbage?

           Coming, Dad!

           too, will ya? My feet are like

           INT. BABCOCK'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Norman's mother, SANDRA BABCOCK, is emptying the
           dishwasher. She is in her late thirties, and wears `mom'
           clothes that do no favors for her figure. His father,
           PERRY BABCOCK, is older, with a neatly-trimmed beard
           trying hard to delineate chin from neck. He stands on a
           chair, decked out in tool belt and safety goggles, even
           though he's only changing a light bulb in a ceiling
           fixture.
           Sandra smiles at her son as he makes his way silently to
           an overstuffed trash can as tall as he is.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Hi. Whatcha watching in there?

                          NORMAN
           Sex and violence.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Oh. That's nice.
           Perry glares over as Norman wrestles with the garbage.

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           Can't you be like other kids your
           age and pitch a tent in the yard,
           or have a healthy interest in

                          NORMAN
           I thought you said kids my age
           were too busy shoplifting and
           joyriding?

           Breezing into the kitchen through the back door while
           CHATTING inanely on her cell phone, Norman's older sister
           COURTNEY is fifteen years-old and is the bleached-blonde
           cheerleader archetype of every schoolboy's sordid dreams.

                          COURTNEY
           Oh yeah, he's r-i-double p-e-d.
           Like, a seven pack at least.

                          (TO NORMAN)
           Ew! Watch it!
           She pushes her brother out of the way as he drags the
           garbage outside.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Courtney, be nice.

                          COURTNEY
           Yeah, she totally doesn't deserve
           him. I mean, she's nice and I
           really like her, but she's a
           complete loser. Yeah, I know.
           Courtney slumps into a chair at the table, twisting a
           strand of gum out of her mouth with a finger.
           Norman returns inside and shuts the door, pausing a
           moment as if thinking something over.

                          NORMAN
           Dad? Grandma says, ""Can you turn
           up the heating?"" Her feet are
           cold.
           The bubble Courtney is blowing POPS against her face,
           Perry rolls his eyes and GROANS, and Sandra pales.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK

                          COURTNEY
           Oh yeah? Prove it!
           Norman levels her a look that says ""you asked for this"".

                          NORMAN
           She said it's not very ladylike to
           hide photos of the High School
           quarterback with his shirt off in
           your underwear drawer.
           Sandra and Perry raise their eyebrows.

                          COURTNEY
           I knew it! You've been sneaking
           around in my personal stuff!

                          NORMAN
           No I haven't! Grandma told me!

                          COURTNEY
           You are the worst!
           Courtney, brimming with outrage, storms out of the
           kitchen, her ponytail wagging furiously behind her.
           Sandra kneels down beside Norman with a wearily
           sympathetic smile.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Norman, I know you and Grandma
           were very close, but we all have
           to move on. Grandma's in a better
           place now.

           No she's not, she's in the living

           hand of MR PRENDERGHAST. He stands over a dusty desk
           scattered with pictures of Norman, Sandra and older
           family members. He is in a dark study; a wall-to-wall
           trove of curious miscellanea and dumpster-dived junk.

           He pulls an old leather-bound book out from the mess, and
           traces a finger over a woodcut illustration on its cover;
           an ethereal woman lying beneath a cluster of stars.

           At one street corner, Norman bends over a gutter. He is

           He realizes he is being stared at and slowly turns to
           face the onlooker, then hurries away.
           Though no one else sees them, to Norman's eyes, a whole
           host of ghosts are meandering through the streets.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING

           Its industrial days now rusted behind it, Blithe Hollow
           has become a run-down tourist town, celebrating its
           heritage with lame fetes and crass knick-knacks. A
           massive billboard beside the main square reads ""BLITHE
           HOLLOW - A GREAT PLACE TO HANG!"" illustrated by a group
           of waving Puritans beside an equally cheerful witch
           hanging from a gallows. Across the street a huge banner
           suggests this year is particularly important for the
           town; ""BLITHE HOLLOW - 300 BEWITCHIN' YEARS!""
           The town center is lacking in charm; its historical
           buildings subsumed into a vulgar modern thoroughfare with
           gaudy witch-themed shop fronts and cracked sidewalks.
           Everywhere Norman walks, the witch theme is prevalent.
           Cars have bumper stickers that extol such witticisms as
           ""MY OTHER CAR IS A BROOM"". There's a dingy bar, the BAR
           GENTO, and a greeting card store called BEST WITCHES.
           Norman hurries past SHERIFF HOOPER, a heavyset black
           woman, and DEPUTY DWAYNE, lanky and awkward and looking
           like he'd rather be elsewhere.

                          SHERIFF HOOPER
           Watch and learn. ""Parking

           Really? I thought it was Rhona.
           They glance up disdainfully as Norman passes by. Clearly
           in this town Norman has something of a bad reputation.

           of jeering, merciless, pre-pubescent horror. Norman takes
           a deep breath as he begins his daily walk of ridicule.
           Most of the kids give him a wide berth, but others sneer
           and WHISPER as he passes.
           A bell RINGS the start of the school day, and everyone
           makes a bee-line for the building.
           Someone barges Norman with their shoulder, knocking his
           backpack to the ground. Other kids SNICKER as they step
           over him.
           As the last of them head through the lobby doors, Norman
           is left alone on the path.
           Norman bends down to retrieve his spilled possessions,
           and a dark shape beyond the gate catches his eye.
           NORMAN'S POV - Mr Prenderghast, barely visible as he
           stands within the shadow of a tree, stares back at him.
           Norman frowns and squints his eyes, but now sees only
           trees and shadows, so he continues up the steps.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY, LOCKERS - MORNING

           An expanse of unevenly lacquered floor, scuffed by scores
           of dragged heels. Rows of dented lockers line the walls.
           Norman stands before his locker, across which someone has
           daubed the word ""FREAK"" in marker. Clearly something of a
           daily ritual, he reaches inside, takes out a bottle of
           surface cleaner and a rag and proceeds to wipe it off.
           Across the hallway, another kid is removing graffiti from
           his locker. NEIL is overweight with frizzy red hair, and
           is busily rubbing a handkerchief over the word ""FATTY"".
           He watches Norman with interest.
           A voice behind his shoulder gives Norman a start.

                          ALVIN
           Hey, ghost jerk! You know what?
           Norman turns to find textbook bully ALVIN, the only 6th
           grader in his class who shaves, looming over him. He is
           flanked by a couple of leering sycophants, one of whom
           wears a T-shirt emblazoned with ""TEAM ALVIN"".
           Norman SIGHS.

                          NORMAN
           What do you want, Alvin?

                          ALVIN
           Why don't you see some more
           ghosts, goober?

           The kids LAUGH uproariously, encouraging Alvin to show
           off some more.

                          ALVIN (CONT'D)
           Hey! Hey! Norman!
           Alvin points to a fly that has landed on the locker
           beside him. He swats it flat with his hand.

                          ALVIN (CONT'D)
           Talk to that.
           The kids around Alvin burst into LAUGHTER.

                          ALVIN (CONT'D)
           That is so Alvin!
           The bullies strut away, content in the psychological
           damage they've managed to inflict.

                          PUG
           Loser!

                          ALVIN
           That was good, right guys?
           Norman mutters as they leave, but not loud enough so as
           anyone might hear.

                          NORMAN
           Flies don't talk.
           Across the hall, Neil continues to watch with sympathy,
           but he is already being hurried along by his friend
           SALMA, a nerdy Indian kid with braces.

                          SALMA
           Neil, come on. Let's go.

           INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Amidst stacked bleachers, foam mats and stray dodge
           balls, a crudely constructed stage fills one end of the
           gymnasium. Mediocre art class scenery represents a
           colonial town, complete with plywood hills, chapel and
           crescent moon dangling perilously from a basketball hoop.
           In a director's chair far too small for the job is MRS
           HENSCHER, an imposing woman with spectacles and beret who
           looks like she smells of too-much perfume.
           At the front of the stage wearing a pilgrim hat and
           carrying a large scroll, is NORMAN. He is surrounded by
           kids whose attempts at home made period costume leave a
           lot to be desired.

           You stink of illiteracy!

                          (A BEAT)
           Pilgrims? The Mayflower? Don't any
           of you know anything about the
           history of this town?
           Mrs Henscher tries her best to remain unfazed.

           MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
           Puritans were strict and devout
           settlers, who came here to build a
           home, a place without sin. What is
           it now Salma?
           Salma is holding her hand up. She looks like the Wicked
           Witch of the West. Even beneath green makeup and plastic
           warty nose, it is clear she is not best pleased.

                          SALMA
           Why is the witch always a hideous
           old crone with a pointy hat and a
           broomstick? I don't believe it's
           historically accurate, Mrs
           Henscher!
           Mrs Henscher's knuckles clench white around her script.
           She attempts an understanding smile, in the same way a
           shark might.

                          MRS HENSCHER
           It's not supposed to be. It's
           supposed to sell postcards and key
           chains.

                          (CLAPS HANDS)
           So let's try it again. Top of page
           six, Norman.
           Norman skips ahead on his scroll.

                          NORMAN
           The founding fathers of Blithe
           Hollow discovered an evil witch
           amongst them...

                          MRS HENSCHER
           No no, Norman, with gusto! Like
           this!
           Waving her arms theatrically, she bellows Norman's lines,
           milking every syllable for effect.

           MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
           They put her on trial and hanged
           her!

           MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
           But the vengeful witch cursed her
           accusers, seven of them in all, to
           die a horrible and gruesome death,
           and rise from their graves as the
           living dead; their souls doomed to
           an eternity of damnation!

                          (A BEAT)
           Now I want you to try that again,
           but with conviction! My reputation
           is at stake here, and I won't have
           this turn out like that wretched
           Kabuki debacle of oh-nine!
           As she launches into her lecture, Norman notices a change
           in the room. The lights dim, the wind outside picks up,
           and indistinct shapes flicker at the corners of his eyes.
           Norman glances around at the other kids on the stage, to
           see if they are seeing what he is seeing. For a split
           second the children are replaced with faded figures in
           real Puritan dress. Seven solemn figures.
           As he turns around nervously, Norman sees the suggestion
           of another place fizzing in and out of the shadows...

           MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
           Norman! Are you listening to me,
           boy?
           Norman is brought back to the real world with a start,
           and nods timidly from behind his scroll.

                          NORMAN
           Sorry, Mrs Henscher.

                          MRS HENSCHER
           So am I. Now, unless there's any
           other issues, let us resume...
           They put her on trial and hanged
           her!
           Neil turns excitedly to Norman.

                          NEIL
           Ooh! This is my moment!
           He shuffles toward Salma and swings his branch around,
           not realizing Alvin has slung the hangman's noose around
           Norman's neck.
           Norman is yanked off balance and staggers into Neil who
           keels over, rigid branch arms unable to stop his fall. He
           lands on top of Salma, her kicking legs sticking out from
           under him as though Dorothy's house had just landed on
           stage.
           The kids break into uncontrollable LAUGHTER.

           beet red.

           As kids hotfoot it out of the building as quickly as
           possible, Norman stands pitiably in front of his locker.
           Fresh graffiti reads ""SEE YOU TOMORROW, FREAK"".
           Norman heads for the door, and pretends not to hear when
           Neil shouts out behind him.

           Norman keeps going, but Neil quickly catches up, beaming
           intently at the side of his head.

                          NORMAN
           I keep telling you, Neil. I like
           to be alone.

           So do I. Let's do it together!
           You shouldn't let them get you
           down. They always do stuff like
           that to me.

                          NORMAN
           Why?

                          NEIL
           Because I'm fat. And my allergies
           make my eyes leak. And I sweat
           when I walk too fast. And I have a
           lunchbox with a kitten on it. And
           I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I
           guess there's a whole bunch of

           bigger and more stupid, you'd

           EXT. URBAN STREET - DAY

           Norman and Neil walk away from the school along a tree
           lined street at the end of which stands a huge
           commemorative statue. It is a grotesque effigy of the
           evil witch from the local legend.

           MR PRENDERGHAST (O.S.)
           Psssst!
           The boys stop. It seems to be coming from the witch.

                          NEIL
           That statue just ""pissst"" at us!
           Wild-eyed Mr Prenderghast suddenly leaps in front of
           them, startling them as he staggers closer.

                          MR PRENDERGHAST
           You know who I am?

                          NEIL

           Yes. I know. I was told not to
           talk to you. Sorry.
           Mr Prenderghast steps in front of Neil, leaning closer to
           Norman and whispering conspiratorially.

                          MR PRENDERGHAST
           And you know why you're not
           supposed to talk to me?
           Norman tries to back away.

           MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
           I can see ghosts too! And I know
           that's not all you've been seeing
           lately, is it? Bad omens? Things

           There's something you really need
           to know! This is the most
           important thing you will ever

           An apple bounces off Mr Prenderghast's head. He turns to
           find Neil standing behind them on the path, lunchbox open
           in his hand providing leftover low-carb ammunition.

           Don't make me throw this hummus!
           It's spicy!

Voice
Who am I? I've been dreaming about this world which doesn't exist 
in my memory. 
	(Mew swims by)
Who are you? Wait! Am I apart of you...? Or not...?
	(Camera goes into a darker place with orange bubbles then 
it shows someone's eye open. Human figures are seen outside where 
he is.)
Where is this? Who am I? Who brought me here?
	
	(We now see who the voice belongs to, it's Mewtwo.)

Mewtwo
Who am I and why am I here? I just appeared here. I haven't even 
been born to this world yet. Who am I?
	(Mewtwo opens his eyes completely and shatters the glass 
and all the wires fall of him!)

Scientist
It has awakened!

Mewtwo
Did he do this? 

Scientist
Wonderful! Mewtwo has been completed.

   

Mewtwo
Mewtwo?

Scientist
That's you. We created you from a Mew the rarest pok?mon in the 
world! Yes, that's the pok?mon which is said to be the most rare 
of all pok?mon. Mew.

Mewtwo
Mew? Is that my parent? My father? My mother?

Scientist
You can say that, but not really. You've been made stronger based 
on a Mew.

Mewtwo
Who is this? If neither my father nor mother. Then was it god? 
Did God create me?

Scientist
In the world the only ones that can create new life is man and 
god.

Mewtwo
Who did this? Humans made me?

Scientist
This is truly a victory for science.

Another scientist
With this we've proven our theory correct. We can continue the 
study.

Third scientist
This place will become the new Mecca.

Scientist
	(all shaking hands)
I'm going to contact the other offices.

Mewtwo
Who am I? Where is this place? What was I born for?
	(Mewtwo floats up and starts destroying the whole lab. Then 
tons of little metal hand like things come down to stop him but 
he just blows them up. Soon the whole lab is in flames.)

Scientist
To make the strongest pok?mon ever.. that was our dream...
	(The whole lab blows up. Giovanni, the leader of Team 
Rocket comes down in a chopper and confronts Mewtwo.)

Mewtwo
Is this my power? I'm the strongest pok?mon in the world. Mew. Am 
I stronger then you?

Giovanni
You surly are the strongest pok?mon in the world. But there is 
another that would be the strongest.

Mewtwo
The humans?

Giovanni

	(nods)
If you and a human were to cooperate then the world would be 
ours.

  

Mewtwo
The world would be ours?

Giovanni
If your power is set free the world would be ruined. You must 
control your power.

Mewtwo
Control?

Giovanni
Are you okay with destroying the world as it is with that power?

Mewtwo
What should I do? 
	(Giovanni smiles. Mewtwo is at TRHQ getting loads of armor 
put on.)

Mewtwo
Control myself with the armor that protects me? What are you 
going to make me do?

Giovanni
It's simple. All you have to do are the things everyone else has 
been doing...

Mewtwo
and that is?

Giovanni
Fighting, destruction, and plunder. The stronger will win.

--------------------------------------------------------
Mewtwo is sent into an arena to fight pok?mon first an Onix which 
Mewtwo throws into a wall with his mind. Then it shows Mewtwo out 
in a field with a lot of wild Tauros. He raises them up with his 
mind control and TR throws pok?balls out and catches them all. 
Then it shows Mewtwo in the gym again fighting Alakazam, Mewtwo 
does just what he did to Onix. Then came Electron and he used an 
electric attack and Mewtwo reflected it back at him. Next came 
Gary's Arcanine and Nidoking... he took care of them easily. Next 
scene, back in Giovanni's lab.
--------------------------------------------------------

Mewtwo
What am I fighting for? What am I living for?

Giovanni
You are a pok?mon. Pok?mon made by humans, what else are you 
worth?

Mewtwo
My worth? Who am I? What do I live for?
	(Mewtwo starts breaking free of the wires)

Giovanni
What are you doing?

Mewtwo
I was made by humans. But I, who was created by humans, am not 
even a pok?mon.
	(Mewtwo blows up the place and flies off while all his 
armor slowly falls of into the sea. He lands on a rock.)
Who am I? Where is this place? Who asked to make me? Who wished 
to make me? I hate everything that made me! So this is neither an 
attack not a declaration of war but revenge on you who made me!

Introduction
----------------------------------------------------


	(Brock is cooking lunch for everyone.)

Narrator
Ash and the others are on a journey training to be pok?mon 
masters. It's a beautiful day so they take a break in a field.

Ash
Is it ready yet?

Misty
Ash you can help too.

Ash
I can't I can't even move one millimeter because I'm so starved.

Brock
Stew well and raise slowly. You mustn't be in a rush with both 
soup or pok?mon.
	(Pikachu and Togepy spot someone coming)

Pirate
Hey you! The boy over there! Are you Ash from Pallet Town?

Ash
That's right.

Pirate
Can I have a Pok?mon battle with you?

Ash

	(runs over to him)
Okay! I must have a solid fight!

Misty
I thought you couldn't move one millimeter?

Ash
Just one or two pok?mon fights before breakfast.

Brock
This is lunch, so that would be before lunch.

Pikachu
pika..chu...


	(Has the Japanese Pok?mon intro music through this battle 
the whole time. Ash pulls out a pok?ball and throws out 
Bulbasaur. Then the pirate throws out Donfan. Bulbasaur charges 
and Donfan rolls into a ball and hits Bulbasaur, then turns 
around and hits him again! Then he tries it again but Bulbasaur 
uses Solar Beam and Donfan faints. The Pirate then sends out 
Machamp. Ash sends out Squirtle. Machamp kicks Squirtle down and 
then goes to kick him again but Squirtle dodges it and bubbles 
him till Machamp faints. The pirate gets mad and throws 3 
pok?balls down. one is a Venomoth another is a Golem and the 
other is a Pinsir. Pikachu jumps off ashes shoulder and does 
Thundershock and all 3 faint.)

   

Pirate
Oh My God! 
	(this was possibly the funniest part of the entire movie :)

Ash
I did it!

Misty
It was just because your opponent was weak.

Brock
He didn't even raise them well


	(flash to Team Rocket who is on a cliff watching our 
heroes.)

James
Pikachu gets stronger and stronger.

Jessie
Beautiful

Meowth
We couldn't beat him even once. But the word surrender isn't in 
our dictionary.

Jessie
I will get that Pikachu.

James
But look at that. 
	(looks at them all eating)

Meowth
I'm so hungry.

Jessie
I got a frying pan...

Meowth
What good is such a thing without meat and vegetables? It's just 
an iron board.

---------------------------------------------
A Fearow with a camera flies over head then it shows inside some 
place where you can see Ash and Pikachu on the screens.
---------------------------------------------

     

Lady
Are you sending them an invitation?

Mewtwo
Certainly.
	(Dragonite flies out of the control center with a purse. It 
flies over the sees and then over Team Rocket and they fall then 
it flies over Ash and everyone's head knocking them all over then 
she lands.)

Ash
What are you? 
	(Dragonite hands Ash an invitation)
This? For me?
	(He hits a button and a hologram of the lady is displayed)

Lady
Please forgive me for the abrupt letter.

Brock
What a beautiful lady...

Lady
Since you are a promising pok?mon trainer of the future, we'd 
like to invite you to a party of my master who is the strongest 
pok?mon trainer in the world. The place is the New Island, 
Pok?mon Castle. Please check the reply card for whether your 
coming or not. Please accept the invitation for the strongest 
trainer in the world.

Brock
Beautiful Lady...

Misty
What do we do?

Brock
Lets go for it. We should go for it.

Ash
I don't feel uncomfortable with being told I'm a promising future 
trainer.

Misty
Well then check yes on the card.


	(They check yes, and hand the invitation back to Dragonite. 
Dragonite takes the card and flies off but Jessie, James and 
Meowth take out a net in an attempt to steal this rare pok?mon. 
Ash's invitation falls out of Dragonites purse.)

Jessie
Don't say Goodbye without saying hello.

Meowth
a post card?

---------------------------------------------
Scene change. We see Mewtwo waving his hand back and forth moving 
the clouds, causing a big storm to start. We then see mew 
sleeping in a bubble underwater as the bubble floats to the top 
and pops, Mew wakes up and flies off. Ash and everyone run out of 
the storm and into a ocean side house that has all the other 
trainers who were invited.
---------------------------------------------

A Trainer
Calm down Kingler! Cut it out!
	(Our heroes run inside wet.)

Ash
It was a beautiful day!

Brock
The weather along this beach can change easily.
	(we notice a big crowd of trainers by the door and Officer 
Jenny standing with a woman talking to them all)

Crowd
Huh? The ferry has been canceled?

Sweet
We can't go to the New Island?!

Crowd
Oh No! We were invited to go!

Officer Jenny
Be quiet everyone. Here is the Pier Master.

Boijer
I'm Boijer. If you want to know about the sea ask the seagulls on 
the pier. No need to bother. Just look at the flaw of the clouds. 
I've never seen such a hurricane in all my years.

Officer Jenny
Is it that terrible?

Boijer
I grew up on a port and I've never experienced such a storm. 
Besides the storm is above New Island offshore of this pier. I 
can't let you be placed in danger. That's my wish as the one who 
guards this pier.

Officer Jenny
As you heard the ferry has been cancelled.

Umio
Its okay with my pok?mon. My pok?mon are stronger in water. I can 
cross the sea.

Boijer
Wait. I'm the one who knows the sea and I say no!

Officer Jenny
She's right! Besides if the pok?mon were to get hurt now they 
wouldn't be able to get treatment at a Pok?mon Center.

Ash
What do you mean?

Officer Jenny
Nurse Joy at the Pok?mon Center is missing. Pok?mon can't receive 
treatment without Nurse Joy. The poster over there is the missing 
person report
	(Brock looks at it)

Brock
Beautiful... Who? I've seen her somewhere before...
	(Some of the trainers go outside in the storm wanting to 
cross the ocean. Soroa gets onto his Pidgeot and flies off. Umio 
gets on his Gyarados and swims across.)

Officer Jenny
Stop! Stop or I'll arrest you!
	(Sweet gets on her Dewgong and starts swimming away.)

Boijer
There's no use trying to stop them. After all they're pok?mon 
trainers. If they were children who would stop after being told 
to, they wouldn't have gathered here. Let's just pray for there 
safety.
	(Ash, Brock, Misty and Pikachu run outside and see everyone 
leaving.)

Ash
Across the sea lives the strongest trainer in the world. I can't 
cop out now.

Misty
But we can't cross this sea using our pok?mon.

Ash
Right.
	(A Small wooden ship pulls up with 2 people in it. Guess 
who?)

Jessie
Want a ride? Not saying that it's free but depending on the 
situation. I might allow you onboard. 
	(They get on and start going and Meowth is dressed like a 
girl in front of the boat, then a huge wave and Team Rocket's 
costumes fall off. then the waves start getting really rough.)

Ash
You guys! You guys again?!

Brock
You guys appear at the very worst times!

Ash
What do you want?

Jessie
If we're asked what we want...

James
The answer to that is..

Meowth
There's no time for saying that!
	(A huge wave flips the boat. Misty shoots out Staryu and 
swims to the surface.)

Brock
Ash! Misty!
	(Misty comes up and he grabs onto Staryu.)

Misty
Where is Ash and Pikachu?!
(A big wave comes again, and they go back under and see As h 
swimming up with Squirtle.)

  

Ash
Hold on tight everyone!
	(Squirtle and Staryu keep swimming under the waves until 
they see light. Then it shows Mew flying above the clouds. Ash 
and everyone get to the castle and climb out of the water, and 
the mysterious lady is standing there.

Lady
Welcome to the New Island. Please show me your invitation.

Ash
How's this?
	(He shows her).

B rock
That was you just as I thought!

Lady
Yes?

Brock
That picture of Nurse Joy I saw in the missing person report at 
the pier was you.

Misty
That reminds me, she looks like her.

Lady
I don't know what your talking about. I've been serving this 
castle ever since I was born. Come this way. The other guests are 
already waiting.

---------------------------------------------
They go inside and Team Rocket floats up from the water on top of 
Weezing. Then it shows Mew playing with the windmill on top of 
the castle. MEANWHILE Ash and everyone are inside the castle.
---------------------------------------------

Lady
Those are the trainers who have already arrived.

Ash
Only 3?

Lady
The trainers who couldn't cross that storm aren't worth inviting.

Brock
So then you tested us?

Lady
Please take out the pok?mon from the pok?balls and be seated. You 
are the chosen trainers.

James

	(outside and the front door shuts)
Well then, let's sneak into this castle...

Jessie
The only way is to use the exit.

Meowth
Where's the exit?

Jessie
Over there...

Meowth
The s..s..sewer!? I'm not a brown rat!

Jessie
Don't complain!
	(All of a sudden Mew comes down from behind TR and looks at 
them. Jessie turns her head but Mew disappeared.)

James
What's wrong Jessie?

Jessie
Nothing lets go.

---------------------------------------------
Meanwhile...
---------------------------------------------

Sorao
You came too?

Ash
You?

Sorao
I flew here. My Pidgeot can cross such a hurricane in one flight. 
Everyone greet them! 
	(all his pok?mon say their names Then they see a Gyarados.)

Umio
That's my Gyarados. I rode him across the sea. Those kind of 
waves are nothing for it. 

Ash
Gyarados is a brutal pok?mon isn't it?

Umio
Yeah, but if you can handle it, no one is more reliable.

Sweet
My pok?mon are just the same over there. 
	(points to her Blastoise, Wigglytuff, and more. Then all 
the lights turn off, there is a bright beam of light coming down 
the center of a huge spiral staircase.)

Lady
That you for waiting everyone. The strongest pok?mon trainer is 
coming. 
	(All of a sudden Mewtwo starts floating down and all the 
pok?mon get worried.)


Lady
Yes, this is the strongest pok?mon trainer and strongest pok?mon. 
Mr. Mewtwo.
	(The lights come back on and everyone can see him clearly.)

Ash
Mewtwo?

Umio
A Pok?mon is a pok?mon trainer? It can't be. 
	(It becomes apparent that MewTwo is telepathically 
controlling Joy...)

Mewtwo
I've decided my own rules.

Misty
That voice!

Brock
Telepathy!
	(Mewtwo raises Umio up in the air and throws him into a 
pool 
	(using his mind)

Umio
Darn it! Go Gyarados!
	(Gyarados attacks with Hyper Beam, it goes to Mewtwo and 
Mewtwo stops it and turns it around and it hits Gyarados causing 
it to faint.)

Mewtwo
That was easy. 
	(looks at Joy)
I no longer have any need for you anymore.
	(Joy faints into Brock's arms)

Brock
Nurse Joy.

Nurse Joy
Where is this place? Why am I here?

Mewtwo
To make you take care of me, I took you from the Pok?mon Center. 
A doctor who is familiar with pok?mon is convenient. You were 
quite useful. You don't remember anything though.

Brock
What did you say?

Mewtwo
Humans can be manipulated in any way with my power.

Misty
With what power?

Pikachu
PIKA!
	(Meanwhile TR are in the castle and they find a strange 
room and they enter it.)


Meowth
What is this place? 
	(They look and see a Charizard, Venusaur and a Blastoise in 
Big Glass Test Tubes sleeping.)

Meowth
Cute!

James
Is it really?

Jessie
These aren't like any treasures I've seen.
	(Jessie walks away and sits on some button and a computer 
turns on with a very fuzzy screen.)

Computer
...our study... to continue in our research ... we would have to 
collect samples from our test subjects...
	(All of a sudden something grabs Meowth and throws him in a 
machine)

Meowth
HELP! HELP!

Jessie
Meowth!
	(Both Jessie and James start pull to get Meowth out and 
they do get him out but not before the machine got 3 hairs from 
off of his tail.)

Meowth
OUCH! My hair!
	(on the computer screen a figure of a Meowth shows up and 
the computer starts saying some weird stuff then in an empty test 
tube next to Team Rocket, a Meowth falls down from a pipe into 
it)

All of TR
MEOWTH?!

Meowth
I am Meowth.

James
Then this is.... Meowth's copy? 
	(Mew appears behind Team Rocket again.)

Computer
But the copy we created is more than we've imaged. The pok?mon 
which we found.... in the depths... it's name is Mew... We 
succeeded in finding fossilized eye lashes of a mew. From the 
gathered components we created Mewtwo with this machine. The goal 
was to make the strongest pok?mon with our own hands. That was 
our dream. But soon Mewtwo displayed unmeasurable violence. Its 
all over. The research office will be destroyed. The only way 
left to abandon this place and escape. 
	(the computer shuts off)

Jessie
This is the research office?

James
I think so.

Meowth
Yeah

James
But there's nothing wrong with it.

Jessie
Or maybe something created it again.

James
But who?

Mewtwo
I thought of working with humans once. But I was disappointed. 
Humans are the worst creatures inferior to pok?mon. If creatures 
that are weak and cruel like humans control this world, this 
planet will come to ruin. 

Brock
Are you saying like your gonna rule it?

Mewtwo

	(shakes his head)
Pok?mon are no good either because this planet is ruled by humans 
our pok?mon... pok?mon who lived for humans.

Pikachu
Pika..pika pika!

Mewtwo
What did you say? You're not being controlled? You're with the 
humans because you want to be? To be with them by itself is 
wrong.
	(Mewtwo lifts Pikachu up with his mind and throws him but 
Ash jumps back and catches him!)

Pikachu
pika!

Ash
Pikachu!

Mewtwo
Weak pok?mon rely on humans.

Misty
Ash! Are you ok?

Ash
Yeah. How dare you attack Pikachu?!

Soroa
We can get him no matter what kind of pok?mon he is, as long as 
he's a pok?mon, GO RYHORN!
	(Ryhorn charges at Mewtwo and is 1 inch from him and Mewtwo 
stops him and raises him into the air, and shoots Ryhorn across 
the room!)

 

Soroa
Ryhorn!

Mewtwo
It's no use. I was born as the strongest of any pok?mon in the 
world.

Ash
You don't know that before we try.

Mewtwo
You wan to try?

Ash
We can ask for nothing better.

--------------------------------------------------------
Mewtwo eyes start glowing then it shows in the lab with Team 
Rocket in it Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise come out of there 
test tubes and walk out the door. then Mew flies out with them.
--------------------------------------------------------

James
Was that a..?

Jessie
Mew?



Mewtwo
Any human who are aiming to be pok?mon trainers go first. 
Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur.
	(The 3 copies raise up from the ground.)These are the 
evolved forms of the copies I've made. 

Sweet
Copies?

Soroa
They are...?
	(Everything starts shaking and a huge door opens and inside 
is a pok?mon battle field.)

Brock
A battle field? Is he going to have a pok?mon battle?

Soroa
I've got Venusaur for that copy one!

Sweet
I've got Blastoise for that copy one!

Ash
I've got Charizard too. Charizard I chose you!
	(Charizard comes out and gives Mewtwo and evil look then 
shoots fire out at him but Mewtwo makes a force field around him 
so it doesn't even touch him.)
Charizard, that's a surprise attack. 
	(Mewtwo shoots up water and the fire goes out.)

Mewtwo
What a bad tempered Charizard. So who's first?
	(Soroa's Venusaur walks out.)


Soroa
I was careless before, but it won't go that way this time.


	(The copied Venusaur walks out.)

Soroa
Venusaur! Razorleaf!

Mewtwo
Vine Whip.
	(Copied Venusaur's vines chop up the razor leafs then his 
vines wrap around Venusaur and tosses him across the room!)

Soroa
Venusaur!

Sweet
I'm next! Go Blastoise!
	(Mewtwo points for copied Blastoise to go.)

Sweet
Blastoise, Hydro Pump!
	(Copied Blastoise spins right threw the water and hits 
Blastoise causes him to go crashing hard into the wall.)

Sweet
Blastoise!

 

Misty
Be careful Ash! His skills are strong!

Ash
I know.
	(Mewtwo signals Copied Charizard to go.)

Ash
Charizard! Lets fight with speed not power! Okay go!
	(Both Charizard fly up. Ashes Charizard keeps using Flame-
thrower but copied Charizard dodges them all and keeps hitting 
Charizard in the stomach.)

Misty
Where are the speed attacks?

Brock
The enemy is to fast!
	(Copied Charizard grabs Charizard and starts flying down to 
the ground!)

Ash
Charizard!

Mewtwo
Dive Bomb Slam!

Charizard hits into the ground then gets up.. roars loudly.. then 
faints.

Ash

	(Runs out to Charizard)
Hold on Charizard! Are you okay?

Mewtwo
Both speed and power are lacking.
	(Mewtwo then throws his hands up and 3 black pok?balls 
appear he shoots them all out and captures Sweet's Blastoise 
another gets Soroa's Venusaur and the other captures ashes 
Charizard! A small gold statue lifts up and the 3 balls shoot 
down into the hole.)

Ash
STOP!

Misty
Are you taking the other's pok?mon?!

Mewtwo
Taking them? No. I'm going to make stronger copies than the 
pok?mon you are so proud of.
	(Mewtwo raises his arms again and hundreds of Black 
pok?balls appear!)
It's suitable enough for me.

Brock
Copies?

Ash
Stop! That's a violation of the rules!

Mewtwo
Don't tell me what to do. 
	(Mewtwo looks at Ash and throws him into Brock)
I've decided my own rules.
	(Mewtwo drops his arms and all the black pok?balls start 
flying everywhere)

Brock
They're Coming!

Ash
Run everyone!

--------------------------------------------------------
The pok?balls are everywhere catching the trainers pok?mon, the 
Gyarados was caught then the Golduck, then Seaking, then Scyther, 
then Hitmonlee, then Sandslash the trainers are trying to protect 
there pok?mon but there is nothing they can do! then Dewgong was 
caught, then Rapidash, then Vileplume. Then Bulbasaur and 
Squirtle are fighting them off, then Wigglytuff was caught, then 
Pidgeot and when they get caught the pok?balls fly back into the 
whole under the statue lifted up in the air.
--------------------------------------------------------

Ash
I've got it! Take your own pok?mon back to your own pok?balls! 
Return Squirtle and Bulbasaur! 
	(they both go back into their pok?balls)


  

Mewtwo
It's no use.
	(2 black pok?balls go to Ash, open, and capture the 
pok?balls Bulbasaur and Squirtle are in!)
Nothing is impossible with the black pok?balls I have made. 
	(Misty puts Togepy in her bag and shuts it tight while 
Brock holds Vulpix close.)

Nurse Joy
This place is no good. Let's run outside!
	(Nurse Joy, Psyduck, Misty and Brock start running but then 
a black ball catches Psyduck)

Misty
My Psyduck!
	(A black ball catches Vulpix.)

Brock
Vulpix!
	(Pikachu is being hunted down by tons of black pok?balls! 
Then Pikachu falls and is about to be caught! But Ash jumps in 
front of him and the pok?balls hit him.)

Ash
Run Pikachu! 
	(Pikachu is running and starts climbing the spiral stairs 
with ash running after him. Pikachu keeps using Thundershock to 
blow up all the pok?balls around him but more keep coming! Ash 
starts running up the stairs a little behind Pikachu)
Don't give up Pikachu! 
	(Pikachu gets tired and he accidentally falls of the 
stairs! Ash jumps after him and is about to grab him but then a 
black pok?balls snatches Pikachu! But Ash catches the pok?ball 
and then falls into some water but when he does the pok?balls 
slips out of his hands and goes into the hole. Since it was the 
last pok?mon the statue starts to drop but Ash just barely makes 
it and jumps down into the hole after the Pikachu in the ball! 
Team Rocket is still in the Lab, which is where all the copies 
are going. They are amazed at all the copies dropping into all 
the test tubes everywhere but then Ash falls down chasing after 
Pikachu!)

Jessie
Brat?

Ash
I'm sorry, I don't have time to deal with you today!
	(Ash jumps and grabs Pikachu's pok?ball but right when he 
does about 25 little metal mini hand like things come down trying 
to keep Pikachu, Ash is fighting off the mini hands.)
Let it go! Darn it! Let him go! Let go of my Pikachu! Let go! 
	(All the hands break and the whole copy machine starts 
blowing up and Pikachu comes out of his ball.)
Pikachu!

Pikachu
Pika!

But then all the Copy pok?mon start coming out of there tubes 
because the whole copy machine is all blown up. All the copies 
start walking out of the room.

Jessie
Oh no! There coming out!

Meowth
My copy to!

Ash
Those are all copies?

Jessie
Where are they all going?

All of a sudden there's an explosion and all the black pok?balls 
come out and all the original pok?mon come out!

James
The real ones have come out to!

2 of the black balls open and 2 normal pok?balls come out, then 
those open and Squirtle and Bulbasaur come out! Ash and Pikachu 
runs over and starts laughing and hugging each other then ash 
stops and looks up and looks angry!

Meanwhile up stairs...

Mewtwo
Humans, I won't take your lives too. Leave here.

The doors open to the exit.

Mewtwo
That is if you an make it out in that storm.

Then there is an explosion and all the copied pok?mon come 
walking out.

Mewtwo
What happened here?

From the smoke, Ash and all the original pok?mon come walking 
out.

Ash
I can not forgive...! I will not forgive you!

Misty/Brock
Ash!

Misty

	(sees Psyduck)
Psyduck!

Brock

	(sees Vulpix)
Vulpix!

Mewtwo
Did you set them free?

Ash
I will protect my pok?mon, my friends.
	(Ash charges at Mewtwo and goes to punch him but Mewtwo 
throws him down to the ground. Ash gets up and tries again and 
Mewtwo lifts him up.)

Misty
Ash!

Brock
Stop!
	(Mewtwo throws Ash into a huge statue but just as he's 
about to hit it -which we know would really hurt
a pink bubble stops him and Ash bounces a few times on that.)

Mewtwo
What?
	(Mew flies up to Ash and stares at him, Ash then looks at 
Mew and Mew pops the bubble and Ash falls -only like a foot then 
Mew starts giggling.)
You're... 
	(Mew makes another bubble and starts jumping up and own on 
it giggling and having a good time, then Mewtwo makes a black 
electric ball and shoots it up and it pops mew bubble. Mew turns 
around and looks at Mewtwo confused. Mewtwo makes another and 
blows up when it hits Mew. Mewtwo makes 3 more and throws them 
all up at Mew, Mew dodges them all and starts giggling again.)

Brock
That's...

Misty
Pok?mon?

Mew flies down and looks at Mewtwo

Mewtwo
Mew. The pok?mon that's supposed to be the rarest pok?mon in the 
world.

Brock
Mew? 
	(Mew looks around at everyone... I love this guy!)

Mewtwo
I was made from you. But I am the stronger one...I am the true 
one.
	(Mew is still looking around acting like its paying no 
attention to Mewtwo.)

Brock
Mew and Mewtwo.

Sweet
Mewtwo was made from Mew.

Mewtwo

	(starts glowing)
I am the only one who will survive. 
	(Mewtwo starts chasing mew everywhere shooting tons of 
those black electric balls at him. But Mew keeps running away 
dodging everything.)

Mewtwo
Who don't you want to fight? The reason why you avoid fighting is 
because your afraid of me? 
	(Mewtwo makes another black electric ball and shoots it at 
Mew and knocks Mew right in the face and mew goes flying in the 
distance. Everyone is then shocked, but then the same type of 
ball only blue comes back and hits Mewtwo and he goes into a 
wall. Mew flies back down. and Mewtwo floats up from the fire and 
rubble. TR Enters the room.)

Mewtwo
Your attacks are ineffective against me. Now is the time to 
decide which one of us is the true one, you the copy... which is 
the stronger? We were made stronger than the real ones.

Mew
mew, mew..mew mew mew...mew, mew..mew mew mew

Meowth
I see.

Jessie
What is it saying?

Meowth
The real one is real. If they fight only using bodies without 
skills. The true ones will not be beaten by their copies

Mewtwo
The real one is real?.... Fine! 
	(Mewtwo shoots another black electric ball at Mew but Mew 
dodges it and just barely misses Ash! Ash then starts climbing 
down the statue.)
Lets decide which is the real one without skills. You're the 
stronger ones, GO! 
	(All the copies start attacking their originals. The copies 
are winning. Mewtwo makes a visible blue force field around 
himself. Mew does the same except its pink and they fly up high 
in the air and keep ramming into each other. Then Pikachu is 
looking around at the big copy war then he sees his copy standing 
there ready to fight him! Pikachu can't believe it.)


Nurse Joy
What is this fighting? Both the real ones and copies are alive 
now.

Sweet
Everyone is a living thing

Brock
Though they were created, there are living beings that live in 
this world.

Misty
The real ones and the copies... But both of them are the same 
living things. There's no such thing as a win and losing.

James
If we were asked that, I wouldn't know what to say

Jessie
I feel so sorry

James
They're bullying themselves.

Jessie
Its like seeing what we used to be.

James
Its like seeing what we are now.

Both
Feels Bad! 
	(Meowth's copy walks up to Meowth.)

Meowth
Its you! 
	(they take out there claws and are ready fight)
This is gonna hurt. But every pok?mon is fighting each other, 
you're unfair.

Copy Meowth
Meow meow...

Meowth
What? I'm more unfair? It's because I'm not fighting with you? 
Your nails would hurt more wouldn't they?

Copy Meowth
meow meow meow

Meowth
You said tonight's moon would be round? You're right, it must be 
a full moon.

Copy Meowth
meow meow

Meowth
Talking about the moon at a time like this is tasteful. Its 
philosophical.
	(Meanwhile Mew and Mewtwo are still bouncing around 
fighting. And Ash finally makes it back to the ground.)

Ash

	(looks at everyone fighting and getting so tired)
That's Enough! Stop!

Brock
Ash!

Ash
I've got to stop them.

Brock
No. The battle will continue unless Mew and Mewtwo stop fighting.

Nurse Joy
Animals don't hand over there territory to the same type of 
animal.

Misty
oh no.

Nurse Joy
They will fight until they drive their opponents away. That is 
the way of living beings.

Brock
That may be for living beings but Mewtwo was made by humans.

Misty
But now he's a living being. 

Ash
Now they are all living beings. Mew and Mewtwo, Pikachu and that 
other Pikachu. 
	(Mew and Mewtwo's fight finally goes on ground and they 
both take off there force field. Mew and Mewtwo both shoots a 
beam out at each other and starts to run between them not seeing 
the 2 beams coming!)
Stop!

Brock
Ash! 
	(Both beams hit Ash and he falls to the ground and turns to 
stone.)

Mewtwo
It can't be. A human tried to stop our fight. 
	(Pikachu runs out to Ash and starts shaking Ash. Then he 
thunder shocks him many times and Ash still doesn't move. Pikachu 
begins to cry. Then all the other pok?mon look at Pikachu -
including the copies
and they start crying. All there tears float over and land on ash 
then last, Pikachu's tears fall onto Ash and Ash regains his hold 
on life, and turns back to flesh from rock)

Ash
Pikachu!

Pikachu
Pika pi!!

Mewtwo
Actually, both you and I are pok?mon that already exist.

Mew
mew.

Mewtwo
It might be better if no one knows about us, or any of this...

Mew
mew...
	(Mew and Mewtwo start flying away and then all the copies 
pok?mon lift up into the air and fly with them!)

Ash
Why are you going everyone?

Mewtwo

	(flying away with all the copies)
We were born and alive. We will continue to live somewhere in 
this world. 
	(All of a sudden the whole castle fills up with bright 
light and everyone disappears......... Now we are back where all 
the trainers what to go on the ferry.)

Officer Jenny
The ferry has been canceled! There's a hurricane coming!

Nurse Joy

	(walks through the crowd)
Don't worry everyone. I'm going to open the Pok?mon Center as a 
shelter. Follow me those who need it.

Brock
Nurse Joy, the officer, and Ms. Boijer. Even more beautiful than 
usual when they are wet by the rain.

Ash
But why are we here?

Misty
I don't know. We're here because we're here.

Ash
It doesn't matter. Well... Huh? 
	(Everyone runs outside)
It can't be...

Officer Jenny
The hurricane... it's as if it never existed.

Boijer
I can run the ferry for again tomorrow.

Ash

	(looks up and sees a mew in the sky)
Look.

Misty
What? I can't see anything.

Brock
Besides the clouds.

Ash
On the day I left to become a pok?mon trainer, I saw a phantom 
pok?mon... and now.. I've seen it again.

Brock
Phantom Pok?mon.

Ash
Yes, someday I will 
	(Meanwhile, TR is still on the New Island except now the 
castle is gone.)

Jessie
Well if its this empty...

James
Clean and clear...

Meowth
And different than it usually is. 

Jessie/James/Meowth
FEELS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!"
32	Rescuers Down Under The 	Margery Sharp,Jim Cox,Karey Kirkpatrick	Animation,Family,Adventure	November_1990	"(opening:     The camera slowly zooms through a variety of insects and rocks.
              We follow a small yellow bug climb up a blade of grass.  As it
              spreads its wings to fly, we are whisked along the Australian
              outback and prairie by Ayers rock and eventually slow down as we
              approach Cody's house.)

(scene:  inside Cody's room.  The camera pans around to show Cody sleeping
         in his hammock.  The sound of Faloo's call is heard.  Cody hears
         it, jumps out of bed, and runs to the window.  He puts on his
         shirt and grabs his knife.)

(scene:  Cody sneaks past his mother who is in the kitchen listening to the
         radio.)

Announcer:    ... thundershowers are expected in the Crocodile Falls area and
              some of the surrounding gullies so take out your...

(scene:  Outside Cody's house.  Cody leaves the house, and closes the door
         behind him, but not quietly.)

Mom:     (from inside upon hearing the door) Cody!

Cody:    (whincing) Yeah mom?

Mom:     What about your breakfast?

Cody:    I've got some sandwiches in my pack.

Mom:     Well be home for supper.

Cody:    (hopping the gate) No worries mom.

(scene:  Cody runs toward the forest; Faloo's call is heard in the
         background.  He runs past some rock formations and enters the
         woods.  Birds follow him; and squak at him.)

Cody:    (to the birds) I know, I'm coming.

    (Cody jumps over a hollow log)
          Hustle up Nelson, Faloo's sounding the call!

    (Cody slides through a log, picks up a stick, and beats on the roof of
    the wombats home.)
          C'mon little wombats, hurry!

    (Cody continues to run through the forest with all of the animals
    following him.)

    (Cody arrives at the tree where Faloo has been sounding the call.)

         (to Faloo) Who's caught this time?

Faloo:   You don't know her, Cody, her name is Marahute, the great golden
         eagle.

Cody:    Where is she?

Faloo:   She's caught, high on a cliff in a poacher's trap.  You're the
         only one who can reach her.

Cody:    I'll get her loose.

Faloo:   Right-oh, hop on, no time to lose.

    (Cody hops onto Faloo and they travel through the forest and along a
    stream/river; more scenes of animals and the forest.)

    (They arrive at the cliff.)

         (pointing up towards the cliff) She's up on top of that ridge.  Be
         careful lit'l friend.

(scene:  various ""time lapse"" views of Cody climbing up the cliff.)

    (Cody reaches the top and sees the eagle.)

Cody:    Marahute!

    (Cody looks at the eagle; he approaches her slowly; she hears him and
    wakes up; Marahute screeches and struggles to get free.)

         (reassuring) Calm down, calm down.  I'm not gonna hurt you.  (Cody
         strokes Marahute on the head) That's a girl.
         Stay still... it's o.k.

    (Cody gets out his knife; Marahute sees the glint of the knife and
    begins to struggle and scream)

         No wait!  I'm here to help you... easy!... easy!

    (Cody cuts two ropes.  Cody cuts the last rope to free Marahute.)

         You're free!!

    (As Marahute spreads her wings to fly, she knocks Cody off the cliff.)

         Aaaiigh!

    (Cody falls; Marahute dives down to catch him; she catches him just
    before he hits the ground; they begin to fly around; the animals see
    Cody on Marahute and stand in awe; Marahute files over several rock
    formations; the fly up above the clouds; Cody looks at his reflection in
    Marahute's eye.)

         Higher!

    (They fly even higher above the clouds; Marahute throws Cody and catches
    him; Cody is now held in Marahute's talons.)

         Woah!

    (Cody mocks an eagle screech; he laughs as Marahute tickles him; they
    cruise above the clouds which eventually open up to show the ground;
    Marahute nose dives towards the ground and a stream; she holds Cody just
    high enough above the water so that he is water skiing; they approach a
    flock of birds; Marahute lets Cody go and he skims through the birds,
    scattering them; Marahute grabs Cody just before he falls in and then
    put Cody right in front of her, on her beak (pushing him from behind);
    they go over the egde of a waterfall; Marahute catches Cody again; this
    time he rides by standing on her back; they arrive at Marahute's nest)

         Wow!

    (Cody and Marahute look at each other; Cody falls over as he attempts to
    look at Marahute upside down. Marahute moves some grass and feathers to
    show Cody her eggs)

         You're a mom!

    (Cody puts his ear to the eggs)

         They're very warm.  Are they gonna hatch soon?

    (Marahute ruffles her neck feathers in an affectionate manner; she sits
    on the eggs and then looks out ""over her domain"".)

         Where's the daddy eagle?  (Marahute drops her head) Oh... my dad's
         gone too.

    (Cody give Marahute an affectionate stroke;  as they fix the covering on
    the eggs, the wind picks up and blows a feather in Cody's face; he looks
    at it, plays with it, and puts it back.  Marahute picks it up and gives
    it to Cody and he gives her a hug.)

    (Marahute and Cody are now on the ground; Marahute takes off and Cody
    runs around making flying noises)

(scene:  just inside the forest.  A wanted poster of McLeach is posted on a
         tree; A mouse is tied up with a bell attached to it that rings as
         it struggles; Cody hears the bell and goes over to the mouse.)

Cody:    Heh heh... hey little fella, what happened to you?

Baitmouse:    (panicking) Oh no! No, no, no, no!!  Get away, get away! It's a
              trap, it's a trap.  Be careful, NO!

Cody:    (as the mouse is speaking) Don't worry, I'll get you loose.  Woah!
         (Cody falls into the trap.  He looks up to see a blinking light
         and the alarm.)

(scene:  McLeach's truck; the radar has a blip on the screen.)

McLeach: (laughs)  Got one!!

(scene:  back in the hole/trap where Cody has fallen.)

Baitmouse:    (from the top of the hole) Are you alright?

Cody:    (rubbing his head) Yeah, I think so.

Baitmouse:    Okey-dokey. (he runs off)

Cody:    Wait!  Hey!  Come back!

    (Cody tries to climb out; he gets halfway up, grabs a tree root; it
    breaks and he falls; the baitmouse begins to lower a vine down to help
    Cody)

Baitmouse:    Here you go, grab on.

Cody:    That's great, just a little more, a little further... there!  I
         got it.

    (a rumble is heard and the ground begins to shake.)

Baitmouse:    Uh-oh.

    (view of McLeach's vehicle trampling through the forest disturbing
    everything)

Baitmouse:    Yipe!

    (The vine is severed as McLeach's truck comes to a screeching halt; Cody
    falls; the truck opens; Joanna leans over pit and growls; Cody yells)

McLeach: (unseen, approaching the trap) Well Joanna, what'd we get today?
         A dingo, a fat ol' razorback, or a nice big.... (he sees Cody)
         boy?!?

    (McLeach thinks for a second, gives a dirty look to Joanna and kicks
    her.)
         Joanna, you been diggin' holes out here again??  (mumbling to
         himself) Dumb lizard always tryin' to bury squirrels out here.

Cody:    Unh-unh.  It's a trap, and poachin's against the law.

McLeach: Trap?!  Where'd you get an idea like that??  Boy I think you've
         been down in that hole for too long.  (he holds his gun out so
         that Cody can grab it) Well c'mon, grab ahold.  We'll get you out
         of this little ol' lizard hole and you can just run along home.

    (Joanna has spotted the baitmouse on Cody's backpack.  She hisses and
    makes a face.)

Cody:    This IS a poacher's trap and YOU'RE a poacher.

    (The mouse ducks back into the backpack; Joanna jumps on Cody, knocking
    McLeach into the hole; his gun goes off; Joanna begins to attach Cody's
    backpack.)

         (to Joanna) Let go!!  Hey get off of me!!

McLeach: I'm gonna kill her.  (climbing out of the hole) I'm gonna kill
         that dumb, slimey, egg-sucking salamander.

Cody:    Cut it out!  Get off of me!

    (Joanna continues to attack the backpack; McLeach picks up his gun; he
    points it at Joanna; looking through gun scope McLeach aims at Joanna,
    she tries to get out of his view; as she does this, McLeach spots the
    feather in Cody's pack; he picks up Cody by his backpack.)

McLeach: Hmmm.... good girl Joanna.  (Joanna looks up and grins happily.)

         (to Cody) Say where'd you get this pretty feather boy?

Cody:    (humbly) It was a present.

McLeach: (coddling) Oh, that's real nice.  Who gave it to ya?

Cody:    (stumbling) It's a s... secret.

McLeach: That's no secret boy, you see, (menacing) I already got the
         father.  (makes a cutting sound and draws a feather across his
         neck like he was slashing a throat).  He, he he.  You just tell me
         where momma and those little eggs are.

    (Cody breaks free from McLeach by slipping out of his backpack.)

Cody:    NO!!

McLeach: Joanna, sick 'em!

    (Cody runs through forest with Joanna close behind; he enters an open
    area where we see a waterfall and water; Cody stops right at the edge of
    the small cliff that drops into the water (Crocodile Falls); Joanna
    follows close behind; Cody reaches into his pocket and pulls out his
    knife; he drops it; McLeach steps on his hand.)

McLeach: You're comin' with me boy.

Cody:    My mom'll call the rangers!

McLeach: (sarcastically)  Oh no.... not the rangers, what'll I do??
         What'll I do??!  Don't let your mom call the rangers!!  Please
         don't!!  (Joanna laughs) (McLeach laughs)  (McLeach throws Cody's
         backpack into the river)  My poor baby boy got eaten by the
         crocodiles, boo-hoo-hoo!  Let's go boy!

Cody:    (from inside McLeach's cage)  Help!  Help!

    (The baitmouse sees Cody in the cage; he runs to the local RAS telegraph
    office; it begins to rain and wind is blowing; he bursts through the
    door as the telegraph mouse is eating.)

Baitmouse:  (very fast and excited) Help, help, help!!  Someone help!  McLeach
            took the boy.  He took the little boy.  Send for help!!

    (The telegraph mouse begins typing the message in morse code; camera
    pans up to roof, where other mice aim the antenna; message is seen being
    relayed to the Marshall Islands)

    (In a wrecked plane on the Marshall Islands, a mouse listens to the
    morse code message; he recognizes the distress call, activates the
    controls on the plane, and relays message to Hawaii.)

    (Message is seen being relayed to Hawaii.  Screens fill with RAS RAS
    RAS.  Mice are watching through binoculars in the back.  The send a
    signal to other mice.  They dial the phone to distract guard.  Phone
    rings.  Guard leaves.  Mice take over, type (jump) on keyboard and read
    message.  ""RAS... RAS... ATTENTION BOY KIDNAPPED IN AUSTRALIA IMMEDIATE
    ACTION REQUIRED""  They type ""Relay to New York"".)

    (Message then journeys across the ocean to Los Angeles, then to Denver,
    St. Louis, Chicago, Washington D. C. and then New York.)

(scene:  It is winter in New York; through the clouds, the camera descends
         upon the UN building; a mouse is listening to the transmission at
         the RAS headquarters in New York)

Mouse:   Code red, code red!!  Attention all Rescue Aid Society delegates,
         all delegates please report immediately to the main assembly hall.
         This is an emergency meeting.  I repeat, this is a code red
         emergency meeting!!

    (the delegates have been assembling as the announcement was being made)

(scene:  inside the RAS meeting hall)

Chairmouse:   Order!  Order!  Yes, yes I know it's late but I'm... oh really!
            Sir Charles.  Hello, hello Frank, how are you, nice to see you!
            And Esmerelda, there you are!  Ha ha.. all right, quiet now
            please, everyone pay attention.  There has been a kidnapping in
            Australia.  (delegates gasp)  A young boy needs our help.  This is
            a mission requiring our very finest, and I know we are all
            thinking of the same two mice.  (everyone looks to the seats of
            Hungary and USA, which are empty)  (delegates gasp again.)  What's
            this?!?  Gone?  We must find Bernard and Miss Bianca at once!

(scene:  a posh restaurant)

    (as a waiter walks by a pillar/column in the restaurant, a pea drops on
    the floor; a cricket comes out of the column and picks it up.)

Cricket: Oh.... pea soup.

    (With an elaborate contraption, he launches the pea up the column where
    it drops into a thimble-pot of the cook)

Cricket cook: Pea soup!

    (A waiter cricket comes along and picks up the soup; the scene changes
    to the chandelier over the restaurant and we see a mini-restaurant above
    the real one.)

Bianca:  To my dear Bernard, and our wonderful partnership.

Bernard: (nervous and fumbling) Ah... yeah.. yeah.. ah.. won... wonderful.

Bianca:  You've been very quiet this evening, is there something on your
         mind?

Bernard: Well, ummm... actually... I, ah... I was wondering.... (he reaches
         into his pocket.)

Bianca:  Yes darling?

Bernard: I... Miss Bianca would you.... would you... (the ring falls
         through a hole in Bernard's pocket onto the floor) would you
         excuse me for a minute?

    (Bernard chases the ring across the floor; he crawls around, sees it,
    and just as he goes to grab it, a waiter kicks it under another table;
    Francois arrives at their table.)

Francois:     (French accent) Pardonnez moi, mademoiselle Bianca, I have
              important news.  (He hands her a piece of paper.)

Bianca:  Yes Francois?  What is it?

Francois:     You and Bernard have been asked to accept a dangerous mission to
              Australia.

Bianca:  (reading message) Oh the poor boy.  This is dreadful.  Now where
         is Bernard I must tell him at once!

Francois:     Allow me madame, I will tell him immediately.

    (Bernard is seen under a table retrieving ring; the ring finds its way
    onto the foot of a rather large woman mouse who is having dinner with a
    rather nerdy looking man mouse; as Bernard removes the ring from her
    foot, she think the man mouse is playing footsie with her and smacks the
    man mouse.)

Bernard: (practicing)  Miss Bianca, will you marry me?  Miss Bianca, will
         you please marry me?

Francois:     (as Bernard practices) Quickly monsieur Bernard!  I must speak
              with you....

Bernard: Not now Francois, I'm busy!

Francois:     No, no, no, no, monsieur you don't......

    (As Francois attempts to follow Bernard he collides with another cricket
    watier and falls on his back; various crickets run to help him.)

    (Bernard returns to the table)

Bianca:  Bernard, did you talk to Francois?

Bernard: Ah yes, but uh.. there's... there's something I want ......

Bianca:  I know exactly what you're going to say.  Francois told me all
         about it.

Bernard: He did?  How, how... how did he ...

Bianca:  Oh it doesn't matter, I think it's a marvelous idea.

Bernard: (shocked) You do?  I mean, you... you really want to?

Bianca:  I don't think it's a matter of wanting, it's a matter of duty.

Bernard: D-duty?  I... I never thought of it, well, umm... all righ.... all
         right.  How does... how does next ah-April sound to you?

Bianca:  Heavens no!  We must act immediately, tonight!  (she leaves the
         restaurant with Bernard close behind)

Bernard: Tonight?  But, but, ah.. wait!  Uh, Bianca, this is so sudden, I
         mean, don't you at least need a gown or something?

Bianca:  No, just a pair of khaki shorts and some hiking boots!

Bernard: Hiking boots?

(scene:  in the RAS meeting hall)

Chairmouse:   Ah, there you are, come along, come along.

Bianca:  Delegates, we have an important announcement.  Bernard and I have
         decided, (pause) to accept the mission to Australia.

Bernard: (surprised)  Australia?

Chairmouse:   Oh good show!  Now, you must fly out immediately!  It's a little
              nippy outside, but we won't let that stop us, will we?  What?
              (laughs)

(scene:  on top of a building, snow and wind blowing all around)

Bernard: (yelling) Miss Bianca, I'm not sure it's such a good idea to... to
         fly this soon after eating!

Bianca:  Darling you'll be just fine!

Bernard: But aren't, aren't you supposed to wait 45 minutes?

Bianca:  (annoyed) Oh, just knock on the door and see if Orville is there!!

Bernard: (knocks slightly)  (quickly) Well, nobody's home, let's go.

    (Bernard gets buried with snow)

Bianca:  Bernard!!  (scodling) This is no time to play in the snow.

Bernard: I wasn't playing in the snow.  It... it was an avalanche.

Bianca:  Oh look Bernard!   (reading the sign) Under new management, see
         Wilbur.  C'mon darling, let's get a move out!

(scene:  inside Wilbur's hangar; Wilbur is seen singing and dancing along
         with some music)

Bianca:  Yoo-hoo!  Mr. Wilbur!  Hello?

Bernard: Look out!!  Excuse me!

Bianca:  Bernard DO something!  He can't hear us!

    (Bernard ""struggles"" to get to the boom box and Wilbur continues to
    dance.)

Wilbur:  (singing) The girls all look (music stops) when I go by..... Hey,
         who killed the music?!?

Bernard: That's better.

Bianca:  Excuse us for interrupting, we're from the Rescue Aid Society.  I
         am Miss Bianca...

Wilbur:  (interrupting) Miss Bianca!?!

Bianca:  and this is my....

Wilbur:  (still interrupting) THE Miss Bianca?  I don't believe it.  My
         brother Orville told me ALL about you, oh boy, I... this is an
         honor to have.... may I just say enceinte senorita to you?  May I?
         (kisses her hand)

Bernard: Ahem.  (deliberately) We need to charter a flight.

Wilbur:  Well, you've come to the right place, buddy boy, welcome to
         (pause) ""Albatross Air""  -  a fair fare from here to there.
         (laughs)  Get it?  A fair fare?  It's a... a play on... nevermind,
         I've got tons of exotic destinations, far away places, custom
         designed for (in a seductive voice) ""romantic weekend getaways"".
         (laughs)  As well as the finest in-flight accomodations.  Speaking
         of which, what can I get ya?  (fumbles, searches through his
         cooler)  How about a nice mango-Maui cooler?  Very, very nice,
         very tasty....

Bianca:  No thank you...

Wilbur:  Or a ah..... (fumbles about) Coconut guava nectar?  It's
         carbonated.  Very nice.  I got little umbrellas for each one of
         them and a little coconut thing....

Bianca:  No, it's urgent that we leave immediately!

Wilbur:  (disappointed)  Nothing?  Nothing at all?

Bernard: (dismayed) Wilbur.

Wilbur:  How about a cream soda?

Bernard: Now look, we need a flight to Australia.

Wilbur:  Australia?  The Land Down Under?  That's a fabulous idea!  So when
         can I pencil you in?  Ah... after spring thaw?  You know, mid-June
         would be very nice.

Bianca:  Oh know, we must leave TONIGHT.

Wilbur:  (spits out his drink) TONIGHT?  (coughs and laughs) C'mon you're
         kiddin' me right?  (laughs) Have you looked outside?  (he opens
         the window) It's suicide out there!  Oh-ho, oh no.  OH NO....I'm
         afraid your jolly little holiday will have to wait.  (laughs)
         What a bunch of jokers.

Bianca:  But you don't understand, a boy needs our help, he's in trouble.

Wilbur:  A boy?  You mean, a little kid kinda boy?

Bianca:  He was kidnapped.

Wilbur:  Kidnapped?  (remorseful) Aw... that... that's awful.  Lockin' up a
         little kid.  A kid should be free.  Free to run wild through the
         house on Saturday mornings, (gathering strength) free to have
         cookies and milk, and get those little white moustaches, you know,
         with the..... (determined) NOBODY'S gonna take a kid's freedom
         away while I'm around, nobody, do you hear me?!?

Bianca:  Does that mean you'll take us?

Wilbur:  (with conviction) Storm or no storm, Albatross Airlines, at your
         service!! (Wilbur salutes)

    (scene changes to Bernard and Bianca on Wilbur's back)

         Passengers are requested to please fasten their seat belts and
         secure all carry-ons.  We'll be departing following our standard
         pre-flight maintenance.  Thank you.

    (Wilbur begins to exercise)

         Yeah, loosen up, get the blood flowin' up to the head, annnnnd,
         couple of these....oh!  (tries to do a push-up) O.k.  one's
         enough, here we go.  Oh!  Ah yeah!!  That feels better.  Oh baby.
         Tie your kangaroos down sports fans, here, we, COME!

    (opens hangar doors, gets blown back by wind)

         Yeah, let's go for it!!  Woah!  Hey!  Woah!  Hey, I didn't adjust
         for the winds.  All right we're gonna make it!!  I just gotta duck
         down a little lower, that's all.    Go under the wind, go under
         it!  Here we go (screams)!!  Ow this is cold!  Slippery!  Ice!
         Ice!  We got ice!  We got ice!  Oh hang on now!!  Here we go!
         Here we go!  Here we go!!!  HERE WE GO!!  COWABUNGA!!!!!!!

    (Wilbur dives for the street; ""flies"" just in time to miss the ground.)

Bianca:  Captain, is this a non-stop flight to Australia??

Wilbur:  Well, ah...not exactly no, I could definitely say no.  We're gonna
         have to make connections with a bigger bird.  (aside)  Non-stop?
         What do I look like, Charles Lindburgh??

(scene:  McLeach driving his vehicle with Cody in the cage in the
         Australian outback.)

Cody:    (pounding on the cage) Lemme outta here!!  Lemme go!!  You can't
         do this!!  Help!  Help!  Help!

McLeach: (on speaker)  Breaker, breaker, little mate.  I forgot to tell ya
         around here, you need to be QUIET!!  (Cody trips)  Or the rangers
         might hear ya.  Now sit down and relax, enjoy the view.  (laughs)
         Nothin' but abandoned opal mines as far as the eye can see.  And
         dead ahead, is home sweet home.  (begins singing) (from a
         distance) Home, home on the range.  Where the critters are tied up
         in chains.  I cut through their sides, and I rip off their hides.
         And the next day I do it again.  Everybody!  Home, home on the
         range.....

(scene:  long shot of Cody's house)

Mom:     Cody!  Cody!  Cody!

(scene:  cargo hold of airplane; Wilbur, Bernard, and Miss Bianca are
         sleeping on an airplane tire.)

Announcer:    (heard from inside of plane)  Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 12 is
         now approaching Sydney airport, make sure you pick up your parcels
         and packages and enjoy your stay in Australia.

    (Miss Bianca wakes up, gives Bernard a kiss to wake him up.)

Bernard: (just waking up) (yawns) Are we there yet?

Bianca:  Yes.  You know, perhaps we should wake up Wilbur.

Bernard: Oh, oh... alright, I'll get him up.  (leaning over)  Ahhh...
         Wilbur?  (Wilbur is snoring)  Wilbur?  Wilbur??

Wilbur:  (half awake) Um, yeah, just five more minutes ma.  (Wilbur rolls
         over, trapping Bernard and Bianca)

Bianca and Bernard:     (screams) Wilbur!!

Wilbur:  (groggy) That's all I need, five more minutes.

Bianca:  (pleading) Wilbur??  Are you awake??

Bernard: Get, get up we're there!!

Wilbur:  O.k. I'm up, I'm up. (he rolls back over)

Bernard: Watch out you got....

Wilbur:  (groans)  Oh!  I must'a been sleepin' on a bolt.  Ooo.  (plane
         body opens)  Oh boy.  Throw another shrimp on the barbie girls,
         cause HERE I COME!!

Bernard: Here we go again!!

Wilbur:  CANNONBALL!!!!!

Bianca:  Weeee!!

    (Wilbur ""cannonballs"" out of the airplane; he runs into a flock of
    seagulls on his way down and passes the Sydney Opera House.)

Wilbur:  Gang way!  Comin' through, mice on board!!  Clear the way!  Move
         over madam, there you go!  Comin' through sir, thank you.
         (laughs)  Next stop, Mugwomp Flats.  Did we lose anyone back
         there?  (laughs).

Bernard: Miss Bianca, from.. from now on, can't... can't we just take the
         train?

(scene:  Mugwomp flats ""control tower"".  Jake and Sparky are playing
         checkers.)

Jake:    Well Sparky, you've had this comin' for a long time.  And now,
         you're gonna get it.  Ha!

    (Jake jumps one of Sparky's pieces; Sparky spits and then jumps a bunch
    of Jake's pieces.)

Jake:    Hmmm... wise fly.  (Sparky laughs)

Wilbur:  (over radio)  Mugwomp tower, Mugwomp tower, this is Albatross One
         Three requesting permission to land.  Over?

Jake:    Albatross?  (Jake flips over the checkerboard to a chart that has
         various bird sizes)  Let's see... finch, wren, scrub bird,
         lockeet, freckled duck, culah, kukaberra, parrot, cockatoo,
         alba... alba...?!?!  It's a jumbo!!

         (into radio)  Negative one three, you'll have to turn back, our
         runway isn't long enough for a bird your size.

Wilbur:  Not long enough?!?  Look pal, I can land this thing on a dime!

Bernard: (heard over radio) Uh... Wilbur, if, if the runway isn't long
         enough...

Wilbur:  Listen you can't let these radar jockeys push you around.  Just
         leave it to me alright?

Jake:    (into radio) I say again mate, our runway is too short.

Wilbur:  And I say again, MATE, I'm comin' in!!

Jake:    Crazy Yank.  Quick Sparky, we gotta find a way to extend the
         runway.

    (Jake and Sparky begin to make the runway longer; Jake kicks a cinder
    block raising part of the roof.)

Wilbur:  Here we go!

Bernard: We..., we'll never make it!!

Wilbur:  (as he bounces along roof)  Hot!  Oooh!  Ow!  Passengers please
         remain seated until the aircraft comes to a full and complete
         stop.  Thank you.

    (Jake and Sparky continue to extend the runway; Wilbur lands on an
    umbrella and spins around.)

Jake:    Quick Sparky, we need to make a drag line!

    (an elaborate clothesline/hangar/brassiere drag line is constructed;
    Wilbur is catapulted into the drag line; when he stops, he is ""wearing""
    the bra.)

Wilbur:  (cocky) Don't try and tell ME the runway's too short.  Ha!  (to
         Jake) Hold this for me will ya pal?  (Wilbur ""hands"" him the bra
         which launches Jake backwards.)

Jake:    Bloke oughtta have his wings clipped.

Wilbur:  You captain thanks you for flying Albatross Airlines.....

Jake:    (aside to Sparky) Crazy Yanks.  They think they can do any fool
         thing, without regard for.....

    (he sees Bianca; becomes starry-eyed; Sparky wonders what happened;
    looks at Jake; Sparky buzzes in dismay)

         (being suave) Welcome to Australia ma'am.  My name's Jake and if
         there's any way I can make your stay more pleasant, don't hesitate
         to ask.

Bianca:  Oh, how kind.

Jake:    Allow me to get that bag for ya.

Bernard: (struggling)  I've a.... I've got a lot of... luggage here...

Wilbur:  Here let me give you a hand with those bags pal, all part of the
         friendly service here at Albatross Air (Wilbur picks up two of the
         bags; a crunch is heard)  Ow!  Oh!  Big time hurt!  Ah back!!  Oh
         it's out!

Bianca:  Wilbur, are you alright?

Jake:    Don't worry ma'am, I'll handle this.  Sparky, you watch the tower,
         we gotta get this bird to the hospital.

Wilbur:  Oh.... can't go down, can't go up.  Oh ! Take the bags, take the
         bags!

(scene:  an old military hospital vehicle.  Wilbur is being lowered inside
         by a series of ropes, gears and nursemice.)

Nursemice:    Heave!  Ho!  Heave!  Ho!

Wilbur:  Hey, whaddya doin'?  Hey, what... what's going on?  Wait!  Hey
         wait a minute... just stop everything.

Bianca:  Wilbur, don't worry.  We'll come back the moment we find the boy.

Wilbur:  (begging) Wait!  Hey!  Wait a minute!  Don't leave me here,
         please!  I'm feeling much better now.  I'm even ready to hit the
         beaches (laughs).  I'm even ready to mambo.  (Wiggles in the
         restraints).

Bianca:  Doctor, will he be alright?

Doctor:  (consoling) Now, now, my dear.  Keep a stiff upper lip.  They all
         come in with a whimper, and leave with a grin.  Off with you now.
         Leave everything to me.  Shoo, shoo, off you go.

(they leave)

         Hop to it ladies, we've got a bent bird on our hands.  Move, move,
         move, bustle, bustle, bustle.  That's it, ah-ha.

Wilbur:  Will it, will it hurt doc?

Doctor:  Dear boy, you won't feel a thing.  (to the nurse mice) Launch the
         back brace!

    (the ""back brace"" (a cane) is ""launched"" to immobilize Wilbur's back.)

Wilbur:  Hey!  Hey wait!  Wait!  Woah!! I've been skewered.

Doctor:  (cross) I've already missed tea, Mr. Albatross, now don't force me
         to take drastic measures.  You MUST relax.

Wilbur:  Relax?!?  I have never been more relaxed in my life!!  (begins to
         get hyper) If I were any more relaxed, I'd be dead!!!

Doctor:  (smug) I'm not convinced.  (to the nurse mice) Sixty milligrams!

Nursemice:    Sixty milligrams.

    (the nursemice fill hypodermic needle with liquid and put it into the
    chamber of a shotgun.)

Wilbur:  Hey... wha.... are... are you guys crazy?  You can't do that to
         me!  I'm an American citizen buddy!!!

Doctor:  Better double it!

Wilbur:  DOUBLE?!?

Nursemice:    Double, coming up! (they load up another needle in the other
              chamber.)

Wilbur:  Nooo!!

Doctor:  Prepare the albatross for medication.

Wilbur:  Oh, I'm dreamin'... I'm dreamin'!!  Come on Wilbur, wake up boy,
         wake up!!

Doctor:  (giving directions to aim the gun.) Three degrees right.

Wilbur:  Come on!!

Nursemice:    Three degrees right.

Wilbur:  Come on, it's a joke, it's a joke!

Doctor:  Down two degrees.

Wilbur:  Oh no, don't go down two degrees!

Nursemice:    Down two degrees.

Doctor:  Ready!

Wilbur:  No I'm not ready!!  No, please!!

Doctor:  Aim!!

Wilbur:  (crying) please don't do this to me......

Doctor:  FIRE!!

    (the scene changes to outside and we hear the gun fire.)

Wilbur:  Ow, ow, oh. ooo......

(scene:  Mugwomp Flats; Bernard and Bianca are looking at a map)

Bernard: Now we just.... gotta figure out how to get there.

Jake:    So, ah... you and your umm... husband here on a little outback
         excursion?

Bianca:  Oh no, no, we're not married.

Bernard: In fact we're, we're here on a, a top ah.. secret mission.
         Very... very.. hush, hush.

Jake:    Oh!  Gotta rescue that kid McLeach nabbed eh?

Bianca:  Why that's right!  How did you know?

Jake:    (he bumps Bernard out of the way) (whispering to Bianca) You'll
         find it's tough to keep secrets in the outback miss.  (outloud)
         So ah.... which way ya takin'?  (looking at Bernard's map.)
         Suicide trail through Nightmare Canyon, or the shortcut at Satan's
         ridge?

Bernard: Su... Suicide trail?

Jake:    Good choice.  (dramatically) More snakes, less quicksand.  Then
         once you cross Bloodworm Creek, you're scot free, this is until
         ummm... Dead Dingo Pass.

Bernard: (puzzled) Wait, wait, wait a minute, I don't.... I don't see any,
         any of that, that stuff on the map.

Jake:    A map's no good in the outback!  (folding up the map)  What you
         really need is someone, (schmoozing to Bianca) someone who KNOWS
         the territory.

Bianca:  Oh Mister Jake, will you guide us?

Jake:    At your service!  (he bows and shoves the map behind him into
         Bernard's gut.)  Here better take my arm miss it's gonna be a
         treacherous hike.  (beginning to tell a story) I remember the time
         Miss B. it was just me and four hundred of these big giant.....

Bernard: Doesn't even know how to fold a map....

(scene:  the rangers are at Crocodile Falls searching the water; then we
         see Bernard, Miss Bianca and Jake on a wombat in a tree getting
         ready to jump.)

Jake:    This is how we get around in the outback Miss B.  (shouting)  The
         only way to travel, eh Berno?

Bernard: Ah yeah, yeah, it's just a little, a little ah.. bumpy back here.

    (Bernard is bobbing along on the tail; the wombat climbs to the top of
    the tree and jumps.)

Jake:    Cinch up your seatbelts mates, we're comin' in for a landing.

    (the wombat lands on a small bush; Jake and Miss Bianca get off the
    wombat; however the bush isn't exactly stable yet...)

Bernard: Hold it, not, not yet!! (Bernard gets launched into a patch of

           JACK (V.O.)
           Darkness. That's the first thing I
           remember. It was dark, and it was
           cold. And I was scared.
                         
          The silhouette of a body appears as it drifts into a ray of
          light, refracted through water, which turns into...
                         
                         
          A MOON - SEEN IN REFLECTION ON A SHEET OF ICE
                         
          The moonlight intensifies almost magically, and the ice above
          begins to spider-web and crack.
                         
                         
          EXT. FROZEN POND - NIGHT
                         
          Snow-covered trees in every direction. The ice in the pond
          continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. A
          young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense
          moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his
          tousled hair frosted white.
                         
           JACK (V.O.)
           But then...then I saw the moon. It
           was so big and it was so bright,
           and it seemed to chase the darkness
           away. And when it did...I wasn't
           scared anymore.
                         
          Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up
          underneath him.
           JACK (V.O.)
           Why I was there, and what I was
           meant to do - that I've never
           known. And a part of me wonders if
           I ever will.
                         
          Jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight
          as it dims a bit.
                         
          Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something
          with his feet. He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden
          staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the
          staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd.
           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 2.
                         
                         
          Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in
          contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across
          the ice. Jack is visibly confused.
                         
          He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their
          trunks. Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as
          he begins to run across the frozen pond.
                         
          Another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the
          air. Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to
          earth and into the trees. Jack grabs hold of a tree branch
          and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance.

          A collection of simple timber houses with thatched roofs.
          Jack comes in for a landing, and it's a rocky one. He stands
          up, still elated, and brushes himself off.
                         
          As Jack makes his way into town, settlers are warming their
          hands by campfire. Jack doesn't recognize anyone.
                         
                          JACK
           (to the townsfolk)
           Hello. Hello. Good evening,
           ma'am.
                          (BEAT)
           Ma'am?
                         
          The settlers walk past Jack, not noticing him. Jack crouches
          down as a YOUNG BOY runs toward him.
                         
                          JACK
           Oh, ah, excuse me, can you tell me
           where I am?
                         
          The boy runs right through Jack, as if he were a ghost. Jack
          staggers back in shock. He's speechless, as if the wind had
          been knocked out him. His emotions causing it to snow.
                         
                          JACK
           Hello! Hello!
                         
          Townsfolk continue to pass through Jack, unaware of his
          presence. Shaken, Jack turns and retreats into the forest.
                         
           JACK (V.O.)
           My name is Jack Frost -- how do I
           know that? The moon told me so.
           But that was all he ever told me.

          FIERY GYPSY VIOLIN MUSIC as we move through clouds to reveal
          a MASSIVE ICE CANYON, and just around a bend, the incredible
          hidden fortress of NORTH, aka SANTA CLAUS.
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH'S WORKSHOP - DUSK
                         
          We glimpse a familiar-looking RED JACKET and CAP with white
          trim on a coat hanger just as a pair of tongs SLAM a block of
          ice onto a stone work table--
                         
          IN QUICK CUTS: A CHAINSAW shears the block in half, spraying
          ice. North lifts up the chainsaw revealing a massive tatoo
          on his arm, the word NAUGHTY clearly visible.
                         
          Three ELVES huddle in a doorway around a plate of cookies,
          each licking their own tasty morsel.
                         
           NORTH (O.S.)
           Still waiting for cookies!
                         
          As North crosses the background, the elves lower the cookies
          from their mouths, their faces frozen in fear.
                         
          The elves duck out of the way as North launches himself
          across the floor on his rolling chair -- CLOSE as his huge
          HAND gropes furiously among his WORK TOOLS, finally grabbing
          a miniature HAMMER. As North's humming along with his music,
          delicately CHISELING into the ice, we see a second arm sleeve
          tatoo, the word NICE clearly visible--
                         
          His INTENSE BLUE EYE magnified in a JEWELER'S EYEPIECE -- a
          delicate SCULPTING TOOL cuts fine details into the ice--
                         
          His hands place the finished piece on a curving ICE TRACK: An
          ice LOCOMOTIVE. It belches ice vapor and chugs down the
          track, picking up speed--

           Yes!

          One of the elves gives his cohort a look and points to the
          plate as it chews with a mouth full of food, to which it then
          unfurls its tongue and lets the half eaten morsels spill out
          onto the plate.

          He takes a bite and leans toward the ice track. He chuckles
          as the train hits a loop, and launches off a ramp into midair
          -- then WINGS unfold -- JET ENGINES sprout and ignite and the
          train lifts off the track--
                         
          Suddenly, the DOOR is thrown open by one of North's concerned
          YETIS, sending the flying ice locomotive skidding across the
          floor in pieces.

          The yeti cries out covering his mouth in shame. North cries
          out, devastated. The yeti, equally emotional, lets out
          another whimper. North looks down at the broken toy and
          takes a moment to collect himself.

          North leaps up -- draws a HUGE SCIMITAR from its sheath and
                         HEADS OUT--

          Before the Yeti can finish, a WIND whips up from out of
          nowhere -- North stares in outrage as a blanket of SWIRLING
          BLACK SAND, crawls over the lights, and shrouds the ENTIRE
          GLOBE in inky DARKNESS--
                         
          The elves scurry in a panic, then all at once the BLACK SAND
          WHOOSHES UP off the Globe -- rushes up through the ceiling as
          the remaining sand bursts into a puff of smoke and dissipates
          into the air --
                         
          As the wind dies, the scattered pieces of debris settle to
          the ground, and the globes lights come back on, North whirls
          to see a HUGE SHADOW flash across the floors and curving
          walls of his fortress. It quickly disappears, leaving
          nothing but the distant ECHO of...LAUGHTER?

          the shape of a child playing soccer.
                         
          We FOLLOW the Dreamsand stream out his window and up into the

          The strands are being controlled by a small portly figure,
          THE SANDMAN. Suddenly, North's emergency signal zips by. The
          Sandman turns to look and his eyes narrow, visibly concerned.

          Sandy descends from the plane and floats to the ground. He
          joins North, Bunny and Tooth as they walk through the Globe

          smiling as the wind blows past.

                         Once upon a time there was a lovely 
                         princess. But she had an enchantment 
                         upon her of a fearful sort which could 
                         only be broken by love's first kiss. 
                         She was locked away in a castle guarded 
                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
                         Many brave knights had attempted to 
                         free her from this dreadful prison, 
                         but non prevailed. She waited in the 
                         dragon's keep in the highest room of 
                         the tallest tower for her true love 
                         and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
                         Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
                         a load of - (toilet flush)
 
               Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his 
               day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
               after the ogre.
 
               NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

                                     MAN1
                         Think it's in there?

                                     MAN2
                         All right. Let's get it!

                                     MAN1
                         Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
                         thing can do to you?
 
                                     MAN3
                         Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
                         bread.
 
               Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

                                     SHREK
                         Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
                         giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
                         They'll make a suit from your freshly 
                         peeled skin.
 
                                     MEN
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the 
                         jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's 
                         quite good on toast.
 
                                     MAN1
                         Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! 
                         (waves the torch at Shrek.)
 
               Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
               men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
               and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
               men are in the dark.
 
                                     SHREK
                         This is the part where you run away. 
                         (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) 
                         And stay out! (looks down and picks 
                         up a piece of paper. Reads.) ""Wanted. 
                         Fairy tale creatures.""(He sighs and 
                         throws the paper over his shoulder.)
 
                         
               THE NEXT DAY

               There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
               sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
               to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
               are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
               who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
               little pigs.
 
                                     GUARD
                         All right. This one's full. Take it 
                         away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
 
                         
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next!

                                     GUARD
                         (taking the witch's broom) Give me that! 
                         Your flying days are over. (breaks the 
                         broom in half)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. 
                         Next!
 
                                     GUARD
                         Get up! Come on!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Twenty pieces.

                                     LITTLE BEAR
                         (crying) This cage is too small.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please, don't turn me in. I'll never 
                         be stubborn again. I can change. Please! 
                         Give me another chance!
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     GIPETTO
                         This little wooden puppet.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his 
                         nose grows)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Five shillings for the possessed toy. 
                         Take it away.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Father, please! Don't let them do this! 
                         Help me!
 
               Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up 
               to the table.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Well, I've got a talking donkey.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, 
                         if you can prove it.
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, go ahead, little fella.

               Donkey just looks up at her.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Well?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little 
                         nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. 
                         Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
 
                         
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends 
                         to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to 
                         talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing 
                         you ever saw.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Get her out of my sight.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

               The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One 
               of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's 
               hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled 
               with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey! I can fly!

                                     PETER PAN
                         He can fly!

                                     3 LITTLE PIGS
                         He can fly!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         He can talk!

                                     DONKEY
                         Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm 
                         a flying, talking donkey. You might 
                         have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly 
                         but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey 
                         fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins 
                         to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink 
                         to the ground.)
 
               He hits the ground with a thud.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.) 
                         After him!
 
                                     GUARDS
                         He's getting away! Get him! This way! 
                         Turn!
 
               Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. 
               Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared 
               for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He 
               quickly hides behind Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         You there. Ogre!

                                     SHREK
                         Aye?

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized 
                         to place you both under arrest and transport 
                         you to a designated resettlement facility.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, really? You and what army?

               He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well 
               and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail 
               and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and 
               begins walking back to his cottage.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Can I say something to you? Listen, 
                         you was really, really, really somethin' 
                         back here. Incredible!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Are you talkin' to...(he turns around 
                         and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back 
                         around and Donkey is right in front 
                         of him.) Whoa!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell 
                         you that you that you was great back 
                         here? Those guards! They thought they 
                         was all of that. Then you showed up, 
                         and bam! They was trippin' over themselves 
                         like babes in the woods. That really 
                         made me feel good to see that.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's great. Really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, it's good to be free.

                                     SHREK
                         Now, why don't you go celebrate your 
                         freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         But, uh, I don't have any friends. And 
                         I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, 
                         wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll 
                         stick with you. You're mean, green, 
                         fightin' machine. Together we'll scare 
                         the spit out of anybody that crosses 
                         us.
 
               Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very 
               loudly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you 
                         don't mind me sayin', if that don't 
                         work, your breath certainly will get 
                         the job done, 'cause you definitely 
                         need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause 
                         you breath stinks! You almost burned 
                         the hair outta my nose, just like the 
                         time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey 
                         continues to talk, so Shrek removes 
                         his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten 
                         berries. I had strong gases leaking 
                         out of my butt that day.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Why are you following me?

                                     DONKEY
                         I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause 
                         I'm all alone, There's no one here beside 
                         me, My problems have all gone, There's 
                         no one to deride me, But you gotta have 
                         faith...
 
                                     SHREK
                         Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't 
                         have any friends.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Wow. Only a true friend would be that 
                         cruelly honest.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Listen, little donkey. Take a look at 
                         me. What am I?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really 
                         tall?
 
                                     SHREK
                         No! I'm an ogre! You know. ""Grab your 
                         torch and pitchforks."" Doesn't that 
                         bother you?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Nope.

                                     SHREK
                         Really?

                                     DONKEY
                         Really, really.

                                     SHREK
                         Oh.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, I like you. What's you name?

                                     SHREK
                         Uh, Shrek.

                                     DONKEY
                         Shrek? Well, you know what I like about 
                         you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me 
                         thing. I like that. I respect that, 
                         Shrek. You all right. (They come over 
                         a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) 
                         Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live 
                         in place like that?
 
                                     SHREK
                         That would be my home.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. 
                         You know you are quite a decorator. 
                         It's amazing what you've done with such 
                         a modest budget. I like that boulder. 
                         That is a nice boulder. I guess you 
                         don't entertain much, do you?
 
                                     SHREK
                         I like my privacy.

                                     DONKEY
                         You know, I do too. That's another thing 
                         we have in common. Like I hate it when 
                         you got somebody in your face. You've 
                         trying to give them a hint, and they 
                         won't leave. There's that awkward silence. 
                         (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Uh, what?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I stay with you, please?

                                     SHREK
                         (sarcastically) Of course!

                                     DONKEY
                         Really?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please! I don't wanna go back there! 
                         You don't know what it's like to be 
                         considered a freak. (pause while he 
                         looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. 
                         But that's why we gotta stick together. 
                         You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Okay! Okay! But one night only.

                                     DONKEY
                         Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto 
                         a chair.) No! No!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         This is gonna be fun! We can stay up 
                         late, swappin' manly stories, and in 
                         the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh!

                                     DONKEY
                         Where do, uh, I sleep?

                                     SHREK
                         (irritated) Outside!

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, 
                         I don't know you, and you don't know 
                         me, so I guess outside is best, you 
                         know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek 
                         slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do 
                         like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was 
                         born outside. I'll just be sitting by 
                         myself outside, I guess, you know. By 
                         myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's 
                         no one here beside me...
 
               SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

               Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights 
               a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a 
               noise. He stands up with a huff.
 
                                     SHREK
                         (to Donkey) I thought I told you to 
                         stay outside.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (from the window) I am outside.

               There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that 
               made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns 
               and spots 3 blind mice on his table.
 
                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Well, gents, it's a far cry from the 
                         farm, but what choice do we have?
 
                         
                                     BLIND MOUSE2
                         It's not home, but it'll do just fine.
 
                         
                                     GORDO
                         (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes 
                         and lands on his shoulder.)
 
                                     GORDO
                         I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's 
                         ear)
 
                                     SHREK
                         Ow!

                                     GORDO
                         Blah! Awful stuff.

                                     BLIND MOUSE1
                         Is that you, Gordo?

                                     GORDO
                         How did you know?

                                     SHREK
                         Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are 
                         you doing in my house? (He gets bumped 
                         from behind and he drops the mice.) 
                         Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves 
                         with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, 
                         no, no. Dead broad off the table.
 
                         
                                     DWARF
                         Where are we supposed to put her? The 
                         bed's taken.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Huh?

               Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. 
               The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at 
               him.
 
                                     BIG BAD WOLF
                         What?

               TIME LAPSE

               Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging 
               him to the front door.
 
                                     SHREK
                         I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm 
                         a terrifying ogre! What do I have to 
                         do get a little privacy? (He opens the 
                         front door to throw the Wolf out and 
                         he sees that all the collected Fairy 
                         Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, 
                         no. No! No!
 
               The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his 
               pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing 
               flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.
 
               
                                     SHREK
                         What are you doing in my swamp? (this 
                         echoes and everyone falls silent.)
 
                         
               Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a 
               tent.
 
                                     SHREK
                         All right, get out of here. All of you, 
                         move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! 
                         Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more 
                         dwarves run inside the house) No, no! 
                         No, no. Not there. Not there. (they 
                         shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to 
                         look at Donkey)
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite 
                         them.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

                                     SHREK
                         What?

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         We were forced to come here.

                                     SHREK
                         (flabbergasted) By who?

                                     LITTLE PIG
                         Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed 
                         and he...signed an eviction notice.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where 
                         this Farquaad guy is?
 
               Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, I do. I know where he is.

                                     SHREK
                         Does anyone else know where to find 
                         him? Anyone at all?
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Me! Me!

                                     SHREK
                         Anyone?

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! 
                         Me, me!

                         (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy 
                         tale things. Do not get comfortable. 
                         Your welcome is officially worn out. 
                         In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad 
                         right now and get you all off my land 
                         and back where you came from! (Pause. 
                         Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) 
                         You! You're comin' with me.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         All right, that's what I like to hear, 
                         man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart 
                         friends, off on a whirlwind big-city 
                         adventure. I love it!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         (singing) On the road again. Sing it 
                         with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get 
                         on the road again.
 
                                     SHREK
                         What did I say about singing?

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I whistle?

                                     SHREK
                         No.

                                     DONKEY
                         Can I hum it?

                                     SHREK
                         All right, hum it.

               Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.

               DULOC - KITCHEN

               A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually 
               dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         That's enough. He's ready to talk.
 
                         
               The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down 
               onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the 
               table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes 
               up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.
 
               
                                     FARQUAAD
                         (he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs 
                         and plays with them) Run, run, run, 
                         as fast as you can. You can't catch 
                         me. I'm the gingerbread man.

                                     FARQUAAD
                         I'm not the monster here. You are. You 
                         and the rest of that fairy tale trash, 
                         poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell 
                         me! Where are the others?

                         Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's 
                         eye.)
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         I've tried to be fair to you creatures. 
                         Now my patience has reached its end! 
                         Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to 
                         pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop 
                         buttons.
 
                                     FARQUAAD
                         All right then. Who's hiding them?
 
                         
                                     GINGERBREAD MAN
                         Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the 
                         muffin man?
 
                                     FARQUAAD

                                     FARQUAAD
                         Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives 
                         on Drury Lane?

               The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.

                         My lord! We found it.

                         Then what are you waiting for? Bring 
                         it in.
 
               More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. 
               They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic 
               Mirror.

                         hand mirror and smashes it with his

                         and relax, my lord, because it's time 
                         for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. 
                         And here they are! Bachelorette number 
                         one is a mentally abused shut-in from 
                         a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi 
                         and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies 
                         include cooking and cleaning for her 
                         two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. 
                         (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette 
                         number two is a cape-wearing girl from 
                         the land of fancy. Although she lives 
                         with seven other men, she's not easy. 
                         Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and 
                         find out what a live wire she is. Come 
                         on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows 
                         picture of Snow White) And last, but 
                         certainly not last, bachelorette number 
                         three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded 
                         castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! 
                         But don't let that cool you off. She's 
                         a loaded pistol who likes pina colads 
                         and getting caught in the rain. Yours

          A familiar beam of light shines down. The beam of light
          descends onto a stage. Lightning flashes to reveal Prince
          Charming riding his valiant steed Chauncey across the open
          plains. The wind blows back his golden mane.

           my princess awaits rescue from her
           handsome Prince Charming.
                         
          Lightning cracks. Thunder booms. Charming straddles a
          wooden hobby horse and gallops in place. A stage hand uses a
          bellow to blow air into Prince Charming's face. Another
          stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background.
          In the orchestra, a man uses coconuts to create the sound
          effects of a galloping horse. Two more stage hands back
          stage create the cheap sound effects of thunder and
          lightning. A crudely constructed castle tower sits in front
          of a cheaply painted backdrop.

          The audience laughs. Prince Charming glares at them and then
          tries to recover. He points his sword at the monster again.
          The tower facade starts to topple.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
                          (CLEARS THROAT)
           Prepare foul beast-
                         
          Prince Charming looks over his shoulder and sees the facade
          falling. He cringes.
                         
          The scenery slams against the stage, but Prince Charming is
          unharmed, perfectly framed in the princesses' window. The
          crowd laughs at the embarrassed Prince Charming. He shakes
          his mangled sword at the audience.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           (shaking his sword again)
           Someday you'll be sorry.

           We already are!
                         
          They laugh again. Prince Charming throws down his sword,
          picks up his hobby horse and exits.
                         
                          OGRE
           Grrrrrrr!
                         
          The song and the laughter follow Prince Charming backstage.
                         
                         
          INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Prince Charming walks through a tunnel backstage that leads
          to a door. The door has a star with his name written on it.
          He opens it.
                         
                         
          EXT. MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Prince Charming sits at his broken vanity and sobs. His make-
          shift dressing room is in an alley way next to the theater.
                         
          Horses whinny as a carriage passes by. The castle of Far Far
          Away can be seen on the hill in the background. Prince
          Charming breaks down and cries.
                         
          He looks up and sees a picture of the Fairy Godmother taped
          to the vanity. ""Don't stop believing! Mommy's Little Angel""
          is written on the picture.

           Oh mommy.
                         
          He weeps again and then looks back at the picture. A
          determined change grows across his face.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oh, you're right. I can't let this
           happen. I can't.
                         
          Prince Charming looks at the castle on the hill. His
          expression hardens. He stands and faces the castle. He
          holds his chin up high.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           I am the rightful King of Far Far
           Away and I promise you this mother.
           I will restore dignity to my
           throne!
                         
          A big gust of wind blows a newspaper page across his face.
          He peels it off and looks at the headline. His eyes tense
          and narrow.
                         
           PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
           And this time, no one will stand in
           my way!
                         
          In the newspaper is a picture of Shrek and Fiona waving to a
          crowd.
                         
          Prince Charming crumples up the newspaper in his fists.
                         
                         
          EXT. CASTLE - MORNING
                         
          The camera booms down from the Far Far Away sign. The sun
          rises and the birds sing.

          The sun shines through the bedroom window as the camera pans
          over to Shrek and Fiona waking up.
                         
                          SHREK

          Shrek breathes in and smiles.
                         
                          SHREK
                          (DREAMY)
           I know. Isn't it wonderful?
                         
          The bedroom doors fly open and Donkey and the Dronkeys rush
          in. The Dronkeys head right for Shrek and Fiona. Shrek
          cowers beneath the bedclothes.
                         
                          DONKEY

           ""Good morning! Good morning!""
                         
          Shrek sinks further into the blankets as the Dronkeys
          exuberantly lick him. Fiona is amused.
                         
          Donkey starts to sing ""Good Morning"" from Singin' in the Rain
          as he enters the room.
                         
                          DONKEY

           (coming closer and closer
                          TO SHREK)
           ""To you!""

           ""And you!""
                          (TO DRONKEY)
           And you!
                         
          The Dronkeys fly out of the room, knocking down everything in
          their path.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Oh, they grow up so fast.
                         
          Shrek, greatly annoyed, lifts his hand and snuffs out a
          little fire on the bed left behind by the Dronkeys.
                         
                          SHREK
           Not fast enough.
                         
          Puss leaps onto the bed.
                         
                          PUSS
           Okay. You have a very full day
           filling in for the King and Queen.
           There are several functions that
           require your attendance, sir.

           Great! Let's get started.
                         
          Shrek immediately pulls the covers up over his head and
          starts to snore.
                         
                          DONKEY
           C'mon, lazy bones, time to get
           movin'!
                         
          Donkey yanks the sheets off of Fiona and Shrek. He is
          surprised to see Shrek's bare legs.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Aaahhh! You know you really need
           to get yourself a pair of jammies.
                         
          Shrek sighs.

          The camera pans down from a stained glass window. The song
          ""Royal Pain"" by the Eels plays in the background as the
          title: ""Shrek The Third"" is superimposed.
                         
          A large crowd has gathered to watch the knighting. Shrek
          walks down the aisle of the church.
                         
          Shrek walks up to the knight who seems a bit nervous.
                         
          Shrek takes a sword from Puss, but he doesn't have any idea
          what he is supposed to do with it. Shrek looks at Puss, who
          indicates how to knight a person with his own sword. Shrek
          starts to knight the knight.
                         
                          SHREK
           I knight thee...
                         
          Shrek accidentally stabs the knight.
                         
                          SHREK
           He-he. Ooh.
                         
          The crowd, Fiona, Puss and Donkey look on, shocked.

          Shrek and Fiona officiate at a boat christening for the Royal
          Navy.
                         
          Shrek is holding a bottle of champagne. He leans on the
          boat, accidentally pushing it down the ramp. Shrek throws
          the bottle at the boat and it punches an enormous hole in the
          side of the hull. The boat quickly sinks.
                         
          Shrek turns to find the patrons of Far Far Away shaking their
          heads as they leave.

          Raul, the make-up specialist, tightens some aprons around
          Shrek and Fiona. Donkey, Puss and Raul stand in front of
          them.

           here and work on Shrek please?
                         
          Raul stares at Shrek. Shrek raises his eyebrow.

          He unrolls a satchel full of different gardening tools.
                         
          Suddenly Shrek's arms and legs are strapped into a chair.
                         
          A man stands with his back to the camera and pulls on a rip
          cord as if he's holding a chain saw. VROOM! VROOM! He
          turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind
          away at Shrek's gruesome toenails. Shrek cringes.
                         
          We see a close-up of Shrek's eye. A mascara brush comes into
          frame and pulls at Shrek's eyelash.
                         
          Fiona gets her nose hairs plucked.

          Lipstick is applied to some lips. The camera pulls back to
          reveal that the lips are Shrek's.
                         
          A hand tries to tighten a zipper on Shrek's back. It keeps
          snagging on the skin until they finally rip it past and
          tighten up the zipper all the way.
                         
          A small sock is placed onto Shrek's foot. With a shoe horn,
          Shrek's foot is shoved into a small shoe. POP!
                         
          A collar is placed around Fiona's neck and her corset is
          tightened.
                         
          A drill comes into frame and tightens the rivet on Shrek's
          belt. A mole is placed on his cheek.

                          SHREK
           I don't know how much longer I can
           keep this up Fiona.
                         
                          FIONA
           I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please
           just try to grin and bear it? It's
           just until Dad gets better.
                         
          Shrek lets out another frustrated sigh.
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek?
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah.
                         
                          FIONA
           You look handsome.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ah. Come here, you.
                         
          She gives him a supportive smile. He relaxes and smiles
          back.
                         
          Fiona puckers up her lips and Shrek leans in for a kiss, but
          their bulky outfits prevent it.
                         
          Shrek and Fiona let out a huge breath of air.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, my butt is itching up a storm
           and I can't reach it in this monkey
           suit!
                         
          Shrek tries to scratch his butt but to no avail.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh.
                          (WHISTLE)
           Hey you. Come here!
                         
          A man holding a ruby scepter walks over to Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK
           What's your name?

                          FIDDLESWORTH
           Eh, Fiddlesworth, sir.
                         
                          SHREK
           Hoo hoo hooo. Perfect.
                         
                         
          INT. BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The announcer introduces Shrek and Fiona.
                         
           MASTER OF CEREMONIES
           Ladies and gentlemen, Princess
           Fiona and Sir Shrek!
                         
          The audience claps. The curtain starts to open.
          Fiddlesworth is scratching away at Shrek's butt.
                         
                          SHREK
           You've done it. Oh, a little over
           to the left, yeah. That's great.
                         
                          FIONA
           Uh Shrek?
                         
          Fiddlesworth struggles to reach Shrek's itch. The crowd
          looks on in horror. Fiona tries to get his attention.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ahh! All right, you got it...Oh
           yeah, you're on it. Oh that's it!
           Oh that's good!
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek...
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh yeah! Scratch that thing! You
           got it. You're on it. That's
           great!
                         
                          FIONA
           SHREK!
                         
          Shrek and Fiddlesworth finally see the crowd. They both
          freeze. Shrek laughs nervously.
                         
          Suddenly Shrek's belt buckle snaps off and hits Donkey in the
          eye. He stumbles through the crowd screaming.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Ow!! My eye! My eye!
           Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 11.
                         
                         
                         
          As he is stumbling, he grabs hold of a lady in the crowd.
                         
                          WOMAN
           What are you doing?
                         
          The woman pushes Donkey away. He falls, knocking over a
          guard holding an axe on his way down. The guard drops the
          axe. It flies past Puss, who is in the arms of a lady. The
          axe knocks over a vase. The vase flies up on stage and Fiona
          maneuvers to catch it. In flight, water spills out of the
          vase which causes Fiona to fall over.
                         
          Shrek's tuxedo bib slaps him in the face. The clasp holding
          Shrek's pants up breaks off. Shrek stands on stage with his
          pants around his ankles. He shuffles towards Fiona.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona!
                         
          He trips over his pants and hits a loose wooden plank on the
          stage. The plank flings up and sends Fiddlesworth flying
          through the air where his jacket slips over a banner pole,
          trapping him.
                         
                          FIDDLESWORTH
           Uhhh...
                          (WIMPER)
                         
          Shrek has reached Fiona who is still lying on the floor.
                         
                          SHREK
           Are you okay?
                         
                          FIONA
           Yeah. I'm fine.
                         
          Fiona's eyes suddenly widen.
                         
          Fiddlesworth's jacket rips and he falls onto a waiter
          carrying flaming skewers.
                         
                          FIDDLESWORTH
           Ahhhh!
                         
          The skewers fly through the air. Donkey stands up in frame
          with one eye half shut. The flaming skewers shoot by him and
          land in the curtains, setting them on fire. He blows one of
          the skewers out and takes a bite.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Oh! Shrimp! My favorite.

          The fire causes a Far Far Away shield to detach from a wooden
          ceiling beam and fall onto the stage, breaking it in half.
                         
          The whole stage collapses in the middle. The buffet tables
          slide toward Shrek and Fiona at the other end and collide.
                         
          CRASH! BANG!
                         
           CUT TO BLACK:
                         
                         
          INT. SHREK AND FIONA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The door to Fiona's room flies open.
                         
                          SHREK
           That's it! We're leaving!
                         
          Shrek storms in pulling bits of buffet food off his face.
                         
                          FIONA
           Honey, please calm down...
                         
          Shrek grabs the wig off of his head and throws it aside.
                         
                          SHREK
           Calm down? Who do you think we're
           kidding? I am an ogre! I'm not cut
           out for this, Fiona and I never
           will be.
                         
          Shrek wipes off his makeup with his shirt sleeve and flings
          his shirt to the floor. He falls onto the bed next to
          Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY
           I think that went pretty well.
                         
          Shrek startles.
                         
                          SHREK
           Donkey!
                         
          Shrek picks him up and throws him out the door.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Aww, come on now Shrek!
                         
          Shrek slams the door shut.
                         
          Shrek turns back towards the bed and sees Puss reclining on
          his pillow.

                          PUSS
           Some people just don't understand
           boundaries.
                         
          Shrek picks Puss up by the scruff of his neck and tosses him
          outside the window. He shuts it. Puss sits sadly on the
          ledge, giving Shrek his sad-eyes routine. Shrek draws the
          blinds.
                         
          Shrek stomps over and falls back onto the bed. Fiona tries
          to calm him down.
                         
                          FIONA
           Just think... a couple more days,
           and we'll be back home in our
           vermin-filled shack, strewn with
           fungus, filled with the rotting
           stench of mud and neglect.
                         
          This thought calms him. Shrek takes in a long, deep breath
          and exhales. He smiles.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, you had me at ""vermin-filled.""
                         
                          FIONA
           And, uh... maybe even the pitter-
           patter of little feet on the
           floor...?
                         
                          SHREK
                          (LAUGHS)
           That's right. The swamp rats will
           be spawning.
                         
                          FIONA
           Uh, no... you know, what I was
           thinking of is a little bit bigger
           than a swamp rat.
                         
                          SHREK
           Donkey?
                         
                          FIONA
           No, Shrek. Um... what if -
                          THEORETICALLY -
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah?
                         
                          FIONA
           They were little ogre feet?

          Shocked, Shrek falls off the bed.
                         
          He slowly emerges from behind the bed.
                         
                          SHREK
           Honey? Let's try and be rational
           about this. Have you seen a baby
           lately? They just eat and poop and
           they cry and then they cry when
           they poop and they poop when they
           cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby.
           They extra cry and they extra poop.

          She grabs his hands and looks deeply into his eyes.
                         
                          FIONA
           Don't you ever think about having a
           family?
                         
          Shrek takes her hand.
                         
                          SHREK
           Right now, you're my family.
                         
          There is a knock on the bedroom door. The door bursts open,
          revealing a Royal Page.
                         
          Shrek springs up.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well, somebody better be dying.

          The camera pushes through a corridor that leads to the King's
          bedroom. The King is lying on his lily pad, coughing.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           I'm dying.
                         
          The King inhales and launches into a violent coughing fit.
          Shrek looks a bit guilty about his last admission. The Queen
          comes to the King's aid and he settles down.

          The King suppresses a few coughs. He turns to his daughter.
                         
                          KING HAROLD

                          FIONA
           Yes Daddy?
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           I know I've made many mistakes with
           you.
                         
                          FIONA
           It's okay.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           But your love for Shrek has taught
           me so much.
                         
          Fiona smiles. The King addresses Shrek.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           My dear boy, I am proud to call you
           my son.
                         
                          SHREK
           And I'm proud to call you my
           Frog... King Dad in-law.
                         
          Shrek smiles.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           Now, there is a matter of business
           to attend tooo...
                         
          The King starts wheezing and coughing. Eventually he stops.
          They think he's dead. Puss solemnly removes his hat.
                         
                          PUSS
           The Frog King is dead.

          Fiona starts crying. The King suddenly wakes up, coughing.
                         
                          DONKEY
                          (TO PUSS)
           Put your hat back on, fool.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           Shrek, please come hither.
                         
          Fiona gives Shrek a look. Shrek walks over to the King.
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah, Dad?
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           This Kingdom needs a new king. You
           and Fiona are next in line for the
           throne.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ooo. Next in line. Now you see
           Dad, that's why people love you.
           Even on your deathbed you're still
           making jokes.
                         
          The King stares at Shrek, stone-faced. Shrek leans in
          closer.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, come on Dad...an Ogre as King?
           I don't think that's such a good
           idea. There's got to be somebody
           else. Anybody?

36	South Park 	Trey Parker,Matt Stone,Pam Brady	Animation,Comedy,Musical	January_1999	"FADE IN:

        Very happy, Disneyesque MUSIC swirls in.

        PAN DOWN from a pretty blue sky, to a small quaint town
        nestled in the hills. A wooden sign tells us this is South
        Park.

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

        Birds fly into the air, TOWNSPEOPLE smile to each other as
        they walk by.

        It is a scene reminiscent of, if not directly ripped off
        from, the opening number of 'Beauty and the Beast'.

        A little eight year old boy walks happily down the street. He
        is STAN MARSH, a noble looking boy with piercing blue eyes
        and a strong chin. As he walks, he sings a happy song.

                             STAN
                   I'm going to the movies
                   To see the brighter side of life!
                   I'm going to the movie
                   Everything's gonna be alright!
                   Forget all my troubles
                   Put my own life on hold
                   Let a studio tell me
                   how I should view the world
                   Where everything works out
                   I love it that way
                   I'm going to the movies
                   The movies today!

        Stan merrily walks up to a crappy looking house.

        INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

        We are in a young boy's bedroom, just as his alarm clock goes
        off. BRRRRRTTT!!!

                             RADIO ANNOUNCER
                   Good morning South Park! It's five-thirty
                   a.m. on Sunday!! Time to feed the horses
                   and water the cows!!

        From the back, we see the blond haired kid sit up from his
        bed. He stretches, and then walks over to his closet.

        We still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his
        closet and pulls out an orange coat.

        The kid puts his coat on, then turns to camera and pulls the
        hood shut, so that we never get a good look at his face.

                             MOTHER (O.S.)
                   KENNY! YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH!!!

        This boy's name is KENNY, and under his orange coat, we have
        no idea what he looks like, except for his European nose and
        hazel eyes.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm!

        INT. KENNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

        Kenny walks through his small, dirty house and into the
        kitchen, where his MOTHER, FATHER and OLDER BROTHER are
        sitting at the humble table.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Sit down, you can share some of your
                   brother's waffle.

        The doorbell rings. Kenny walks over to the door.

        EXT. KENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

        Kenny opens the door to find Stan.

                             STAN
                   Kenny! The Terrance and Phillip movie is
                   out! You wanna come?!

        Stan shows Kenny a newspaper clipping. It's an ad for the new
        Terrance and Phillip movie 'Asses of fire'. Kenny's eyes
        light up.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm, rmph!

        Kenny walks away with Stan. His mother comes out after him.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Kenny! Where're you going?

                             KENNY
                   Mph mprh mprh rm!

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   What do you mean you don't want to go to
                   church?

                             KENNY
                   Mrmph, rmph rmph rm rmph.

        Kenny and Stan walk down the street.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Well fine, go ahead and miss church!! And
                   then when you die and go to hell you can
                   ANSWER TO SATAN!!

        Dramatic MUSIC STING. Kenny stops, thinks for a minute... And
        then walks off with Stan anyway.

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

        Stan and Kenny now both happily march down the street to the
        happy beat.

        TOM, a plastic surgeon, peeps his head out the door of his
        Rhinoplasty office.

                             TOM
                   Say, where are you boys going?

                             STAN
                   We're going to the movies!
                   To see the brighter side of life!
                   Where everyone is beautiful
                   And have their hair combed just
                   right!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm rmph rm!
                   Mph rm rmph rm!
                   Mprh rm rmph rm rm

                             TOM
                   Have fun you rascals!

        EXT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY

        Kenny and Stan knock at the door.

        A handsome eight year old Semite, KYLE, answers the door.

                             KYLE
                   Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go
                   to church, Kenny?

                             STAN
                   Kyle, check it out.

        Kenny holds up the newspaper clipping.

                             KYLE
                   OH MY GOD, DUDE!!!

        Kyle slips on his coat and heads out the door. But just then,
        Kyle's little brother, IKE, a two year old adopted Canadian
        boy bounces up next to him.

                             KYLE
                   No, Ike! You can't come with me!

        Kyle's MOTHER, a big fat bitch, comes to the door and yells.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Kyle, you take your little brother out to
                   play with you!

                             KYLE
                   Aw, ma!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Do as I say, Kyle!

        Kyle's mother closes the door.

                             KYLE
                   Damn it!!

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

        Now the three boys, and little Ike, merrily strut down the
        street and sing in unison.

                             BOYS
                   We're going to the movies
                   To see the better side of life
                   Where something interesting happens
                   Every day and night!

                             KYLE
                   In movies we can pretend
                   That love is real
                   and good always wins-

                             STAN
                   We can even make believe marriages
                   last!

        A HOMELESS guy is lying in the alley.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Spare a dollar? Spare a dollar?

        Stan walks by and throws a dollar at him. The homeless guy
        suddenly jumps up.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   I'm going to the movies!
                   To see the brighter side of life!
                   I'm going to the movies
                   Everything's gonna be alright!
                   Forget my troubles
                   Put my own life on hold
                   Let a studio tell me
                   how to view the world!

                             KYLE
                   Let's go get fat ass!

        EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE - DAY

        This house looks just like all the others.

        INT. THAT SAME HOUSE

        CLOSE UP on a bag that reads 'CHEESY POOFS'. A hand reaches
        into the bag, pulls out a wad of orange crunchies and raises
        them --

        BOOM UP to reveal the fat face of eight year old ERIC CARTMAN
        who chows down on the chips.

        Now we see that fat little Eric is sitting on his couch,
        eating Cheesy Poofs and watching television.

        The doorbell rings. Cartman doesn't move a muscle.

                             CARTMAN
                   MOM! SOMEBODY'S AT THE DOOR!

        CARTMAN'S MOTHER enters. She is extremely June Cleaveresque
        (except that she's a hermaphrodite crack whore). She returns
        with Stan, Kyle and Kenny.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Look, Eric it's your little friends.

                             CARTMAN
                   What the hell are you guys doing here?

                             IKE
                   Baba turtre bad!

        Kyle holds up the newspaper ad.

                             CARTMAN
                   Ooh!

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

        Now all four boys are merrily walking down the street and
        singing.

                             BOYS
                   We're going to the movies
                   To see the better side of life!

                             CARTMAN
                   Maybe there'll be pirates!
                   Or a whole city burnin'!
                   Maybe we'll see a monster
                   Or, better yet, Uma Thurman!

                             BOYS
                   We're going to the movies!
                   Everything's gonna be okay!

        The boys skip out of frame.

        EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

        The movie theatre is nestled neatly between two other South
        Park buildings.

        The boys walk up to the geeky, teenage TICKET GUY.

                             BOYS
                   Going to the movies!
                   The movies today!!!!!

                             STAN
                   Can I get five tickets to Terrance and
                   Phillip Asses of Fire, please?

                             TICKET GUY
                   No.

        Suddenly, all the happy music that has permeated the film
        comes to an ABRUPT HALT.

        The boys look confused.

                             KYLE
                   What'dya mean, no?

                             TICKET GUY
                   Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire is
                   rated 'R'. You kids can't get in.

        The boys look shocked. They just stand there, in silence.

                             CARTMAN
                   The hell we can't! My money is just as
                   good as any white person's!

                             TICKET GUY
                   You have to be accompanied by a parent or
                   guardian.

                             KYLE
                   But why?

                             TICKET GUY
                   Because this movie has naughty language,
                   and it might make you kids start using
                   bad words.

                             CARTMAN
                   Listen you son of a bitch, if you don't
                   let us in to see this movie I'm gonna
                   kick you square in the nuts.

                             TICKET GUY
                   Sorry, Charlie.

                             KYLE
                   Damn it!

                             TICKET GUY
                   Next, please?

        A few TEENAGERS walk up to get their tickets. The boys step
        aside.

                             STAN
                   This is terrible! This can't be
                   happening!!

                             KYLE
                   We HAVE to see this movie, dude!

                             CARTMAN
                   Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that
                   good anyway.

                             KYLE
                   Cartman! What the hell are you talking
                   about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!

                             CARTMAN
                   Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it
                   probably can't sustain itself over ninety
                   minutes.

                             IKE
                   Poo baba!

                             STAN
                   Wait! I've got an idea!

        EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - A LITTLE LATER

        The old Homeless guy from the intro song walks up to the
        Ticket Guy with the boys.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Uh, hi. I want five tickets to Terrance
                   and Phillip Asses of Fire.

                             TICKET GUY
                   You realize this movie is rated R? It may
                   not be appropriate for your little ones.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Oh.
                       (Turning to boys)
                   Hey, he says this movie isn't appropriate
                   for you.

                             STAN
                       (Whispering)
                   Look, homeless guy, if you don't want to
                   buy us tickets, and NOT get your ten
                   bucks and NOT go buy yourself a bottle of
                   Vodka and not forget about how miserable
                   your life is and not stop the voices in
                   your head then go right ahead.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Five tickets please.

        The Ticket guy suspiciously hands them over.

        INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

        The boys are all sitting in the front row. Cartman has a huge
        tub of popcorn, all kinds of candy, and a large drink.

                             IKE
                   Purpre mama!

                             KYLE
                   Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!

        ANGLE - MOVIE SCREEN

        A TITLE reads 'Terrance and Phillip - Asses of Fire'

                             BOYS
                   HOORAY!!!

        On the screen, we come across PHILLIP, a very handsome
        Canadian star with a great body.

                             PHILLIP
                   Say Terrance, what did the Spanish Priest
                   say to the Uranian gynecologist?

        PAN OVER to TERRANCE, who is also Canadian, and equally
        handsome in a more rugged way.

                             TERRANCE
                   I don't know, Phillip, what?

        Phillip rips a big fart. Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

        ANGLE - BOYS

        Laughing their asses off.

                             KYLE
                   That was sweet!

                             STAN
                   Where do they come up with this stuff?!

                             CARTMAN
                   How come Terrance and Phillip are so
                   weird looking?

                             KYLE
                   Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like
                   Ike!

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh.

                             IKE
                   Poo bada!

        ANGLE - SCREEN

                             TERRANCE
                   You're such a pigfucker, Phillip!

                             PHILLIP
                   What?! Why would you call me a
                   pigfucker?!

                             TERRANCE
                   Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck
                   pigs.

                             PHILLIP
                   Oh yeah!

        Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

        ANGLE - BOYS

                             KYLE
                   Woa, dude! Did they say what I think they
                   said?

        ANGLE - SCREEN

        Terrance pulls out a white envelope.

                             TERRANCE
                   Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I
                   just got a letter!

                             PHILLIP
                   A letter from who, you shit sucking cock
                   master?

        TRACK IN on the boys' wide eyed faces as the dialogue from
        the film enters their innocent ears.

                             TERRANCE
                   It's from your mother.

                             PHILLIP
                   My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it
                   say?

                             TERRANCE
                   It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever
                   tell my son that I licked your hairy
                   balls.'

        Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

                             PHILLIP
                   Oh, you fucking ball whore!

        The boys don't laugh, they just smile widely, they seem busy
        taking it all in.

                             CARTMAN
                   Wow... Ball whore...

                             TERRANCE
                   Listen, you donkey raping shit eater-

                   Unclefucka!  That's YOUUUUUUU!!!!!

        The song ends and the boys erupt into applause.

        EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

        The boys walk out of the theatre with glazed eyes and wide
        smiles.

                             KYLE
                   Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!

                             CARTMAN
                   You bet your fucking ass it was!

                             STAN
                   Fuck, dude, I wanna be just like Terrance
                   and Phillip!

                             TICKET GUY
                   Hey wait a minute... Where's your
                   guardian?

                             STAN
                   Huh?

                             TICKET GUY
                   I knew it! You PAID a homeless guy to get
                   you in, didn't you!

        The boys think a second.

                             CARTMAN
                   Suck my balls.

                             KYLE
                   Yeah,

                   Shut your fucking face,
                   Unclefucka!!

        The boys walk away, merrily. The ticket guy is in shock.

                             TICKET GUY
                   Oh oh, I'm in trouble.

                             BOYS
                       (Singing, fading off)
                   You're an asslicking, ball sucking
                   Unclefucka!!

        EXT. STARK'S POND - DAY

        All the children of South Park are gathered at the pond for
        ice skating.

        The scene is reminiscent of the skating scene from the
        Charlie Brown Christmas special.

        Delicate snowflakes fall, children laugh and skate, and
        joyous music plays.

        The boys walk up to the pond.

                             CLYDE
                   Hey, where have you guys been all day?

                             STAN
                   Oh, nowhere... We just went out to go see
                   the TERRANCE AND PHILLIP MOVIE!

        All the kids gasp! Dramatic MUSIC STING.

                             BEBE
                   You saw it?!

                             CLYDE
                   How'd you get in?!

        Suddenly, all the kids are gathered around the boys. They're
        like celebrities.

                             CARTMAN
                   Hey! Stop crowding us you shitfaced
                   cockmasters!

        All the kids stop, wide eyed. As if they've just hear the
        voice of God.

                             KIDS
                   Wowwww...

                             STAN
                   Yeah, you're all a bunch of ass ramming
                   unclefuckers.

                             KIDS
                   Ooooohhh!!!

                             CLYDE
                        (To another kid)
                   We HAVE to see this movie, dude.

        The other kids nod.

                             CARTMAN
                   Hey Stan, tell 'em about when Terrance
                   called Phillip a testicle shitting rectal
                   wart! Stan? Stan?

        But Stan is elsewhere, because out on the ice, skating
        gracefully, is little eight year old WENDY TESTABURGER.

        The heavens part, a CHOIR OF ANGELS sing, as Wendy skates
        around and around, performing a series of impossible Triple
        Lutzes, Sowcows and what-have-you-not's.

        All the animals of the forest -- deer, birds, bunnies -- all
        stop to admire her.

        Stan's smile grows wider and wider. Kyle turns to see what
        he's looking at.

                             STAN
                   Thank my lucky stars
                   Here before me now
                   Is everything I'd ever hoped for
                   Knew it in a word
                   Saw it in a glance
                   The only thing I think I'd die
                   for...

                             KYLE
                   Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that
                   fucking song again.

        ANGLE - WENDY

        Spinning and soaring in slo-mo.  Effortlessly covering every
        inch of the pond with her ballet maneuvers.

        Stan is slack-jawed.

                             STAN
                   I can't stop now
                   My heart's awake
                   I pray her arms
                   my arms to take
                   So this is why I'm ali-

        Wendy finishes her routine with a triumphant Hamill-camel
        landing right in front of Stan and spraying ice in his face
        and abruptly ending his song.

                             WENDY
                   Hi, Stan!

        Stan vomits profusely all over himself.

                             WENDY
                   Ew! Gross!

        Just then, another kid skates up, spraying more ice in Stan's
        face. His name is GREGORY, and he is a very handsome eight
        year old boy, with golden hair and an open-buttoned shirt. He
        speaks with a rich English accent.

                             GREGORY
                   Come, Wendy, let us try to jump the hilly
                   brush.

        Stan looks at Gregory.

                             STAN
                   Who are you, kid?

                             GREGORY
                   My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's
                   counter-cousin for some time.

                             WENDY
                   Want to skate with us?

                             GREGORY
                   We've been skating all morning. And
                   laughing and talking of memories past.

        Gregory skates away. Stan looks stunned. Finally, he tries to
        get Wendy's attention.

                             STAN
                   We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!

                             WENDY
                   That's nice, Stan.

        Wendy skates after Gregory. Stan looks completely rejected.

                             KYLE
                   Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new
                   guy?

                             STAN
                   She's not my girlfriend, dude!

        Meanwhile, the schoolkids are all still gathered around
        Cartman.

                             CARTMAN
                   Yes, I saw the Terrance and Phillip
                   movie. Who wants to touch me?  I said,
                   ""Who wants to touch me?!""

        A small boy steps forward and tentatively touches Cartman's
        arm.

                             SMALL BOY
                   Oooooh...

        EXT. SOUTH PARK - TOWN - MORNING

        Establishing shot of the little town of South Park which
        consists of four buildings. The sun rises in the background.

        It's a brand new day.

        EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

        The elementary school is nestled peacefully between two
        mountain peaks.

        INT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

        The kids of South Park are all in their seats, singing.

                             KIDS
                   Shut your fucking face,
                   Unclefucka!!
                   You're a shitsucking, cocksucking
                   Unclefucka!!

        The door opens, and suddenly the kids quiet down.

        CLOSE-UP on a hand puppet with a large red hat. It seems to
        be speaking.

                             MR. HAT
                   Okay, children, let's take our seats.

        As the voice continues, we PULL BACK to reveal that the
        puppet is on the right hand of MR. GARRISON, a forty-six year
        old teacher who is in denial about his homosexuality.

                             MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
                   We have a lot to learn and precious
                   little time.

        Garrison looks over the class and notices that every single
        one of them is wearing a Terrance and Phillip T-shirt,
        except, of course, for Wendy.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Why is everyone wearing T-shirts of
                   Sigfried and Roy?

                             KYLE
                   It's not Sigried and Roy, Mr. Garrison,
                   it's Terrance and Phillip.

                             KIDS
                   TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!

        Stan looks over at Wendy. She just rolls her eyes. Stan
        sulks.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Well, anyway... Today children, our
                   friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all
                   about the environment.

                             MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
                   That's right, Mr. Garrison. The
                   environment is what surrounds us. It is
                   what we live and breathe.

                             CARTMAN
                   I hate the environment.

                             KYLE
                   Dude, how can you hate the environment?

                             CARTMAN
                   'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and
                   fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.

        The kids all GASP!

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Eric! Did you just say the ""F"" word?

                             CARTMAN
                   Fragile?

                             KYLE
                   No, he's talking about fuck, dude. You
                   can't say fuck in front of Mr. Garrison.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Kyle!

                             CARTMAN
                   Why the fuck not?

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Eric!

                             STAN
                   Dude, you just said fuck again.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Stanly!

                             KENNY
                   Mph.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Kenny!

                             CARTMAN
                   That's bullshit! If Terrance and Phillip
                   can say something, I should be able to
                   say it too!

                             BEBE
                   Wow, Cartman's cool!

                             CLYDE
                   He's like Terrance and Phillip!

        Cartman gloats proudly.

                             CARTMAN
                   Fuckin' a right.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   How would you like to go to the
                   principal's office?

                             CARTMAN
                   How would you like to gargle rat jiz?

        Mr. Garrison is in shock.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!

                             CARTMAN
                   I said -

        Cartman takes out a megaphone, hits the switch and puts it
        to his mouth. It feeds back horribly.

                             CARTMAN
                        (Through megaphone)
                   HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GARGLE RAT JIZ?!

        Garrison is floored.

                             KYLE
                   Oh, dude we are fucked now.

        INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

        The boys are seated in front of the Principal's desk.

                             STAN
                   Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw
                   the Terrance and Phillip movie!

                             KYLE
                   Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!

        Just then, the Principal walks in. She is PRINCIPAL VICTORIA,
        a frizzy haired woman of about forty.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   I am VERY disappointed in you boys!
                   You should be ASHAMED of yourselves! I've
                   already called in your parents, but first
                   I want you to THINK about what you've
                   done.

                              CARTMAN
                   Principal Victoria, can I ask a question?

                             PRINCPAL VICTORIA
                   What?

                             CARTMAN
                   What's the big fucking deal?

                             STAN
                   Yeah.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   AGH!! I want to know where you heard
                   these horrific obscenities!

        The boys look at each other.

                             STAN
                   Nowhere.

                             KYLE
                   I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few
                   times before...

                             STAN
                   Yeah!

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Boys, I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison
                   ever said-
                        (Reading)
                   'Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass
                   spelunker' in school!

        The boys all laugh.

        But then the door opens and in walks Stan's mother, Kyle's
        mother, Cartman's mother and Kenny's mother.

                             STAN
                   Oh, oh...

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Thank you all for coming on such short
                   notice. As you can see, your boys are all
                   being disciplined.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   This just isn't like you, Stanley!

        Stan looks down at the floor.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What did my son say, Principal Victoria?
                   Did he say the S word?

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   No, it was worse than that...

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                        (Gasping)
                   The F word?!

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   No, worse. Here's a short list of the
                   things they've been saying.

        The mothers look over the sheet of paper. Immediately, their
        eyes bulge.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   Oh dear God...

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What is 'fisting'?

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   That's when the fist is inserted into the
                   anus or vagina for sexual pleasure.

        The two moms stare at Ms. Cartman.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   What?

              EXT. JUNGLE VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS

              A relatively modern village... for a remote jungle. Dawn is
              JUST barely beginning to break. The morning mist persists as
              we see FOUR FEDERALES with machine guns surrounding a group
              of VILLAGERS.

              O
               N GROUND - A WOMAN VILLAGER is thrown down. Her SON, 8, runs

          1
              to her side. She's mad. Her son cries.

                        You monsters!
              UP ANGLE - As we see the THREE FEDERALES, greasy men, holding
              AK-47's, and looking down with hardened indifference. OS, we
              hear an EVIL CHUCKLE. The men part as we see-
              - COL. PANTERA. A bottom-heavy disgusting pig of a man walks
              up between them. Pantera leans down, face to face with her.

                        your village.
              ANGLE ON - Their jeep, overflowing with the Village's
              precious crops.
              WIDER - A tiny group (10) of other villagers stand at a safe
              distance. The Woman's HUSBAND runs forward. He immediately
              LUNGES at Pantera, just as-
              -SHIKA-SHIKA - Pantera is flanked by 3 MACHINE GUNS pointed
              at the Husband's chest. Pantera slothfully grins. He leans
              forward and yanks an HEIRLOOM NECKLACE from her neck.

                                  PANTERA
                        After all, the jungle can be a very
                        dangerous place. BAH-HAHAHAHA.
              They jump into the Jeep and tear into the jungle LAUGHING.

              The jeep clamors down the bumpy makeshift path. Pantera sits
              in the passenger seat as the others are crammed in around the

              ahead. Slams on the brakes. Pantera is thrown around.

          CORTEZ leaps out. Grabs the winch from the front of the jeep
          and pulls it to the log, roughly 15 feet away.
           EEP POV - Pantera and Driver barely notice the out-of-focus
          bg Cortez get suddenly YANKED out of scene!

                               CORTEZ (O.S.)
                    ...yirk!
          ON DRIVER - His eyes go wide. Trying to see in the dark.

                              DRIVER SOLIDER
                        (softly, nervous)
                    D-d-dios mio.
          ON LOG - Cortez is gone. Pantera wakes up.

                              PANTERA
                    What?! WHAT IS IT?!
          OS - Hear the sound of a CHAIN clinking. Then WHOOSHING as
          the chain winch suddenly FLIES IN, and CRACKS the BURLY
          SOLDIER across the jaw! It wraps itself around his neck.
          Before he can react...
          - YOINK! He gets pulled over the hood of the jeep, landing on
          the ground HARD.

                                URLY SOLDIER

                    OOF!
          Burly gets pulled backward... away from the Jeep and into...
          the darkness. He SCREAMS the entire way, clawing the ground.
          ON JEEP - Driver is freaking out now. Last Soldier is in the
          back. Pantera stands up in the jeep. ""Last"" jumps out and
          readies his machine gun.

                              PANTERA

                    The jungle god that punishes those
                    who prey upon the weak.
                        (looks scared to Pantera)

              OS NOISE - Suddenly hear the whooshing of 4 quick punches,
              kicks, a short machine gun burst and a WHUMP. Pantera and
              Driver look to the ground.
              ON GROUND - Last Soldier lays beaten on the jungle floor.

                                  DRIVER SOLIDER
                        I'm sorry, senor.
              Driver bounds out of the Jeep and runs SCREAMING into the
              jungle. CAM PULLS BACK with him as Pantera shrinks in bg.

                                  PANTERA

                        COWARD!! GET BACK HERE!!
              Something suddenly skitters behind Pantera! He turns to look.
              Nothing. He reaches down and pulls up... a MACHETE.

                                  PANTERA

                        SHOW YOURSELF! DO YOU REALIZE WHO

                        YOU'RE DEALING WITH?!
              ON PANTERA - He circles backs against the Jungle wall, trying
              to find him. Tense. Suddenly-
              -a PAIR OF WHITE EYES open in the blackness behind him!
               n a quick series of shots we see Pantera getting the raw end
              of a flurry of fist and foot attacks. His attacker is moving
              way too fast for the camera to keep up.
              Pantera falls back, panting heavily. Panicked. He tears off
              into the dense Jungle!
              ON PANTERA RUNNING THROUGH JUNGLE - Thick foliage. Panicked.

              An oasis of calm, violated by this sweating, machete-
              clutching brute. He stumbles, then stands in the middle.

                        Actually... it's ""Turtle"", pal.
              Pantera swings around. Eyes wide.
               N ATTACKER - We pan up the thick green legs. Muscular and
              strong. Further up. Arms to match. Rough skin. It wears a
              shorn HOODED PONCHO. Inside are two white eyes and gritted
              smiling teeth.
              The poncho falls to the ground.

              ON ATTACKER - It's LEONARDO! Beaten blue bandana blowing in
              the breeze. Total hero shot. He pulls out a SINGLE KATANA
              SWORD, poised for battle. Pantera's backed into a corner.

                                  PANTERA
                        Let's see if a ghost can die, then.
              Pantera SCREAMS and runs to Leo and starts swinging! At the

              The Boy is still at the Village Clearing. Suddenly -
              - the sound of the JEEP begins to rumble in the distance! The
              villagers panic and scatter. VROOM! The Jeep flies out of the
              jungle and bounce-slows into the FG!
              Only there is no one driving it... and it still has the
              stolen food in it. And the stolen medallion dangles from the
              rear view mirror.

                                  WOMAN VILLAGER
                        It's a miracle!
              The village rejoices. The Boy steps aside for a beat, looks
              back at the Jungle. Something catches his eye.
              ...a small crouched figure on a tree branch. Barely
              silhouetted. His white eyes lit in the darkness. One of them
              WINKS as the boy smiles.

              Leo leaps into frame. He takes out his katanas and lays them
              carefully on the ground. He KNEELS, head bowed, eyes closed.

              A mouse-level shot of the spectacular city that never sleeps.
              It's oddly hypnotic. Still. Until...
              - BAM! A pair of sneakers land barely in front of the camera,
              tearing off into the distance.

                                  NYPD #1 (O.S.)

                        FREEEZE! STOP OR WE'LL SHOOT!
              Shoes belong to a panicked MUGGER, early 20's, as THREE NYPD
              OFFICERS clamor after him. The Mugger is a jackrabbit -
              hopping newspaper machines, rolling under passing trucks and
              doing anything he can to avoid arrest.
               ventually the NYPD peter out. The mugger looks back. Smiles.

                                  MUGGER
                        Heh, heh... suckers.
              ON MUGGER - His eyes suddenly go wide as - VROOOOOM! - we see
              a jet-black tweaked out motorcycle fly over the cops' heads,
              aiming directly for Mugger!

                                   MUGGER
                        Whaaa!!!
              The Mugger runs, but can't escape. The Driver is dressed in
              all-black motorcycle leathers and black-visored helmet. Scary
              and faceless. He quickly gains on the Mugger and GRABS him by
              the collar in mid-stride!

                                  MUGGER
                        You crazy?! Put me down, man!
              But Driver doesn't. Instead, he holds him lower without
              stopping the bike... and proceeds to plow Mugger's head into
              every trash can and garbage bin along 9th Avenue!

                                  MUGGER

                        OW! HEY! WHAT'RE YOU-OW!! OOF!
              Just as it looks like he'll hit a telephone pole... Driver

               EXT. DEAD END ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Driver tosses him onto the ground at full speed. Mugger
               SLIDES down the alley and collides with a pile of garbage
               like he's a human bowling ball.
               ON HEAD OF ALLEY - The Driver guns the bike and kicks up a
               ton of dust and racket, peeling donuts at mouth of the alley.
               And then he stops. Dust slowly settles and smoke dissipates.

                                   MUGGER
                         Wh-wh-what kinda freak are you?!
               The Driver gets off the bike. Silence. Backlit by headlight.
               He walks directly to the Mugger with purpose. Mugger starts
               to really freak out. Driver picks him up by the collar and
               SLAMS him to the back WOODEN FENCE WALL.

                                   MUGGER
                         P-p-please. Don't kill me, man.
               Driver just cocks his head. Mugger can see his own terrified
               reflection his Driver's black visor. Driver reaches behind
               his back and pulls out a COMBAT KNIFE! He reels back and...

                         Wh-wha-wha-WHAT ARE YOU DOI- AAAGH!

               W
                HAM! - Driver nails the dagger through the Mugger's JACKET,
               PINNING HIM TO THE WALL. Driver turns around to gather the
               purse's belongings at the mouth of the alley.
                fter he stops cringing, the Mugger wriggles the blade out of
               the wall. Driver doesn't notice as - THWIP-IP-IP! - he hurls
               the knife at the Driver!
               THUNK! It sticks in the DRIVER'S BACK!
                N MUGGER - His grinning eyes suddenly GO WIDE as Driver
               slowly turns around, UNHURT! The Mugger is trapped as Driver
               moves toward him... and a BOLO CHAIN drops to his side.
               ON WALL SHADOW - as we see a flurry of punches, kicks and
               throws as Driver lays a beating on the criminal who needs to
               be taught a lesson. An OS Police Siren chirps.
               MOUTH OF ALLEY - The police suddenly show up, cherries
               flashing. They run to FG, mouths drop.

               CLOSE ON - A PAIR OF TURTLE EYES... MICHAELANGELO'S! They're
               wide with FEAR. Nervously darting around, unable to keep up
               with the surrounding danger.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Dude! They're all around me! What
                         do I do? WHAT DO I DO?!
               Mikey's eyes continue to panic. DONATELLO's voice comes in
               over a RADIO. Calming.

                                   DONATELLO (O.S.)
                         Just relax, Mikey. Remember your
                         training. You'll be fine.

               INT. UPTOWN APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

               The cam pulls out of a LARGE MASCOT HEAD - looks like a big
               goofy Turtle head with googly eyes and dumb smile. WIDER we
               see a fake ZIPPER spirit-glued onto Mikey's plastron. In his
               hands, he holds two nerf-styled NUNCHUCKS.

                         Okay - waita-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA!!
               Suddenly TEN KIDS WITH BIRTHDAY HATS AND FOAM NUNCHUCKS run
               in SCREAMING and start beating on Mikey... a little too hard.

                                   SCREAMING KIDS
                         Get him! Yeah! You suck! Hey!
                         Awright! Take that, Turtle-dork!

               End WIDER with the kids all walking away from Mikey, now on
               the floor doubled over from the ""playing"". A beat, then-
               -one more kid runs back and kicks Mikey.

               Beautiful downtown autumnal street. Parked in front, we see
               the ""COWABUNGA CARL"" PARTY VAN loudly decorated in kid-

               Mascot Mikey is standing at the door, holding a fistful of
               cash, still in full costume.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         I can only hope they're as lovely
                         as the rugrats you got here.
               ON KIDS - They look tough, brandishing their nerf weapons - a
               toddler street gang. One of the kids does a finger-point-then-
               throat-slit gesture. The mom looks and beams. The kids
               quickly smile to cover.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         Such... angels.
               Mikey looks to the side, and sees the still piled-high stack
               of PIZZA BOXES through the fake head POV.

                                   SOCCER MOM

               reaches in quickly a grabs a box of pizza. The door closes.

               Mikey opens the van's rear doors. He PULLS OFF the fake
               zipper on his chest and then pulls off his fake turtle head.
               His trademark orange bandana spills out.
               He turns, breathing in the fresh surface air. A quiet beat
               until - A POLICE SIREN approaches, faint, in the distance.
               Mikey jumps in the van, slams the door shut as the car
               whizzes by.
               WIDER - the van takes off down the street.

               EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - LATER

               CLOSE ON - a regular motorist sitting in his car at a traffic
               light. Don monitors from a small dashboard cam. Man looks OS
               Left. Reacts.
               OFF HIS LOOK - We see Mikey beside him in the van. He's
               behind the wheel - face FROZEN in a goofy SMILE like a
               ventriloquist to ""hide"" his identity. Don follows on a small
               surveillance cam under the rearview mirror.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

                         All's I'm saying Donnie is that no
                         one would notice if YOU did one of
                         these gigs every now and again.

                         But you add such... panache to the
                         character.
               Mikey, emotional, pops into ""fully animated"" facial mode. He
               rubs his sore neck.

                                   MICHAELANGELO
                         Well, if panache is French for
                         ""punching bag"", I'd have to agree
                         with ya.

               A darkened room lit only by the lights of dozens of tv's,

               ON CAR - The Man is still looking - only now really freaked
               out - at the fully animated Mikey head.

                         Aw nuts.
               Mikey suddenly grips his face back into a tight SMILE,
               frozen. He looks over and waves at the man who confusingly
               waves back.

                                   MICHAELANGELO

               Mikey immediately ""unfreezes"" and sticks his tongue out and
               antics at the Man! Before the man can react, Mikey TEARS OUT
               and zips across traffic down a deserted side-street.
               ...as we notice the annoying ice cream style music tinkering

               The van parks in a long-forgotten alleyway. A dummy gate
               closes behind it, obscuring it from view.

               The dripping concrete and metal maze explodes with the

               But this isn't just any half-pipe - it tests all of Mikey's
               skills in ninjitsu, extreme sports and cross-training. He
               jumps on and off the board to occasionally tackle obstacles
               with all four limbs. A fun rock n' roll sequence.
               Feels like Mikey is miles away from the surface world when he
               arrives at a seemingly DEAD END. He smiles as he reveals a
               BRICK DUMMY WALL that brings him to...

               Mikey lands in the ""foyer"" of sorts. Atop entrance stairs. He

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

A row of moving boxes lie on the floor of the room.  They
are drawn up in crayon to look like a miniature Western town.
The bedroom is lined with cloud wallpaper giving the
impression of sky.

One of the boxes has a children's illustrated ""WANTED""
poster of a Mr. Potato Head taped to it.

A MR. POTATO HEAD DOLL is set in front of the poster.  The
VOICE OVER of ANDY, a 6-year-old boy, can be heard acting
out all the voices of the scene.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Alright everyone, this is a stick-
            up!  Don't anybody move!  Now empty
            that safe!

A GROUP OF TOYS have been crowded together in front of the
""BANK"" box.

Andy's hand lowers a CERAMIC PIGGY BANK in front of Mr.
Potato Head and shakes out a pile of coins to the floor.  Mr.
Potato Head kisses the coins.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Ooh!  Money.  Money.  Money.
                   (kissing noises)


A porcelain figurine of the shepherdess, BO PEEP, is brought
into the scene.

                         ANDY (AS BO PEEP)
            Stop it!  Stop it, you mean old
            potato!

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Quiet Bo Peep, or your sheep get
            run over!

The companion porcelain sheep are placed in the center of a
Hot Wheels track loop.

                         ANDY (AS SHEEP)
            Heeeeelp!  BAAAAA!  Heeeelp us!

                         ANDY (AS BO PEEP)
            Oh, no!  Not my sheep!  Somebody do
            something!

WOODY, a pull-string doll cowboy, enters into the scene
opposite the inanimate spud.

Andy's hand pulls on the ring in the center of Woody's back.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Reach for the sky.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Oh, no!  Sheriff Woody!!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            I'm here to stop you, One-Eyed Bart.

Andy's hand pulls out one of Mr. Potato Head's eyes.

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            Doooooh!  How'd you know it was me!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Are you gonna come quietly?

                         ANDY (AS POTATO HEAD)
            You can't touch me Sheriff!  I
            brought my attack dog with a built-
            in force field!

Andy places a TOY DOG, with a SLINKY for a mid-section, in
front of Mr. Potato Head and stretches him out.

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Well I brought my DINOSAUR, who
            eats force field dogs!!

Andy reveals a PLASTIC TYRANNOSAURUS REX, who stomps on the
Slinky Dog.

                         ANDY (AS DINOSAUR)
            AAAAR!  ROAR-ROAR-ROAR!

                         ANDY (AS SLINKY DOG)
            YIPE!  YIPE-YIPE-YIPE!

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            You're goin' to jail, Bart.

Andy picks up Mr. Potato Head and places him in a baby crib
in the room.

A cardboard sign is taped to the bars with the word ""JAIL""
written in crayon.

                         ANDY (AS WOODY)
            Say good-bye to the wife and
            tatertots.

Andy's 1-year-old sister, MOLLY, crawls over and picks up Mr.
Potato Head.  She sucks on him for a beat then proceeds to
pound the toy repeatedly against the rail of her crib,
forcing some of his parts loose.

Andy, wearing a cowboy hat himself, picks up Woody off the
floor.

                         ANDY
                   (pulling Woody's string)
            You saved the day again, Woody.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            You're my favorite deputy.

BEGIN TITLES

SONG ""YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME"" plays while Andy does
various activities with Woody:

-- Andy turns the Western town boxes around to reveal cows
drawn on the other side.  He grabs a jump rope and pretends
Woody is lassoing the cattle.

                         ANDY
            C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle.

-- Andy then rides Woody around on an RC (remote control)
car, and herds the remaining ""cow"" boxes under Molly's crib.

INT. STAIRWELL

-- Andy places Woody on the top of the stairwell banister
allowing the doll to slide downstairs.  Andy races ahead and
catches him at the bottom.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS LIVING ROOM

-- Andy & Woody fall into the La-Z-Boy chair and spin around
and around.

Next, Andy uses the La-Z-Boy foot rest as a catapult.

Andy flings Woody across the room to the sofa.

                         ANDY
                   (raising his arms)
            Score!

SONG ENDS

Woody lies limp on the sofa while Andy is heard talking to
his mother.

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Wow!  Cool!

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Whadda ya think?

                         ANDY (O.S.)
            Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!

ANGLE: THE ADJOINING DINING ROOM

MRS. DAVIS, Andy's thirty eight-year-old mom, has just
finished decorating the area with streamers and balloons.  A
banner is draped across the archway.  It reads: ""Happy
Birthday Andy.""

Woody's frozen face stares in the direction of the birthday
decorations.

                         ANDY
            Can we leave this up 'til we move?

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Well, sure, we can leave it up.

                         ANDY
            Yeah!

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Now go get Molly.  Your friends are
            going to be here any minute.

                         ANDY
            Okay.

Andy picks up Woody from the couch and runs upstairs.

                         ANDY
            It's party time, Woody!

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Andy and Woody enter the room.  Molly is still banging
Potato Head against her crib railing.  Andy tips Woody's hat
at her.

                         ANDY
            Howdy, Little Lady!

He deposits Woody on the bed and pulls his string one last
time.

                         WOODY (VOICE BOX)
            Somebody's poisoned the waterhole.

                         ANDY
                   (picking up Molly)
            C'mon, Molly.  Oh, you're getting
            heavy!
                   (to Woody)
            See ya later, Woody.

Andy exits.

END TITLES

Woody's eyes come to life.  The cowboy doll sits up, his
expression changing from a smile to worry.

                         WOODY
                   (to himself)
            Pull my string!  The birthday
            party's today?!

Woody thinks.

                         WOODY
                   (to the room)
            Okay, everybody.  Coast is clear.

The bedroom comes alive.  TOYS emerge from the toy box, the
closet, the shelves, etc... in a flurry of activity.

POTATO HEAD, his body parts strewn across the floor, sits
himself upright and begins to re-assemble himself.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Ages three and up.  It's on my box.
            Ages three and up!  I'm not
            supposed to be babysitting Princess
            Drool.

HAMM, the piggy bank, flips one last penny into his coin
slot.  Potato Head walks up to him.  All his facial pieces
are in the wrong slots.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Hey, Hamm!  Look!  I'm Picasso!
                         HAMM
            I don't get it.

Hamm walks away.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            You uncultured swine!
                   (to someone O.S.)
            What are you looking at, ya hockey
            puck?!

Potato Head walks past, revealing a hockey puck figurine.

Woody sits on the edge of the bed observing all the activity.
He turns to a plastic green army man, SARGENT, standing on
the night stand.

                         WOODY
            Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?

                         SARGENT
                   (saluting)
            Sir!  No Sir!

                         WOODY
            Okay, thank you.  At ease.

Woody hops off the bed.

                         WOODY
            Hey, Slinky?

                         SLINKY (O.S.)
            Right here, Woody!

A toy Slinky dog, SLINKY, appears from under the bed pushing
out a checker board set.  He begins to place the checkers on
the board.

                         SLINKY
            I'm red this time.

                         WOODY
            No, Slink --

                         SLINKY
            Oh...well alright, you can be red
            if you want.

                         WOODY
            Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad
            news.

                         SLINKY
            Bad news?!

                         WOODY
            Sh-h-h-h-h!!

Woody covers up Slinky's mouth, aware that the other toys in
the room are watching.  He leans in close to Slinky.

                         WOODY
                   (whispering)
            Just gather everyone up for a staff
            meeting and be happy!!

                         SLINKY
            Got it.

Slinky shuffles off.

                         WOODY
            Be HAPPY!

Slinky perks up his gait and LAUGHS HARD.

Woody proceeds in the other direction.  He passes a toy
ROBOT and SNAKE partially hidden under the bedspread.

                         WOODY
                   (to the room)
            Staff meeting, everybody.
                   (aside)
            Snake, Robot -- podium duty.

Robot and Snake come out from under the bed and reluctantly
follow Woody.

Woody walks past an Etch-A-Sketch, ETCH, going the other
direction.

                         WOODY
            Hey Etch!  Draw!

Both Etch and Woody whip around like gunfighters.

Before Woody can fully extend his arm out, the Etch-A-Sketch
etches a gun on its screen.

                         WOODY
                   (pretending to be shot)
            Oh!! You got me again, Etch! You've
            been working on that draw.  Fastest
            knobs in the west.

Slinky passes a group of toys on the floor.

                         SLINKY
            Got a staff meeting, you guys, come
            on, let's go!

Robot and Snake begin constructing a podium made out of
Legos and a Tinker Toy tub while Woody searches the floor.

                         WOODY
            Now where is that -- ?  Aw, hey,
            who moved my doodle pad way over here?

Woody spots the doodle pad on the floor by the desk and
walks over to it.  As he reaches down to pick it up...

REX, the plastic dinosaur, jumps out to scare Woody.

                         REX
            ROOAAAARR!!!

                         WOODY
                   (unaffected)
            Oh, how ya doin', Rex?

Rex suddenly turns timid.

                         REX
            Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.

                         WOODY
            I was close to being scared that time.

Woody heads back to the podium.  Rex follows.

                         REX
            I'm going for fearsome here, but I
            just don't feel it.  I think I'm
            just coming off as annoying.

A crook suddenly grabs Woody's neck and jerks him towards BO
PEEP, the porcelain figurine.

                         WOODY
                   (choking)
            Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.

                         BO PEEP
            I wanted to thank you, Woody, for
            saving my flock.

                         WOODY
                   (blushing)
            Oh, hey - it was nothing.

                         BO PEEP
            Whadda ya say I get someone else to
            watch the sheep tonight?

                         WOODY
                   (very flustered)
            Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...

Bo saunters back towards her lamp stand, passing a stack of
ABC blocks.

                         BO PEEP
            Remember, I'm just a couple of
            blocks away.

Woody is left lovestruck.

All the rest of the toys in the room are filing past Slinky.

                         SLINKY
            Come on, come on!  Smaller toys up
            front.

Woody remains lovestruck in the middle of the room.

                         SLINKY
            Hey, Woody!  C'mon!

Woody snaps out of his trance and rushes over to the podium.

The toys crowd together as Woody steps up to the podium.
MIKE, a toy tape recorder, waddles up next to Woody and
indicates his microphone.

                         MIKE
            Ahem!

                         WOODY
                   (grabbing microphone)
            Oh, thanks, Mike.
                   (to the crowd)
            Okay --

SFX: FEEDBACK

                         WOODY
                   (to Mike)
            Oh, whoa, step back --

Mike waddles back a step to stop the feedback.

                         WOODY
            Hello?  Check?  Better?  Great.
            Everybody hear me?  Up on the
            shelf, can you hear me?  Great!
            Okay, first item today...oh, yeah.
            Has everyone picked a moving buddy?

The toys all MOAN.

                         HAMM
            Moving buddy?!  You can't be serious!

                         REX
            Well I didn't know we were supposed
            to have one already.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
                   (waving his arm out
                   its socket)
            Do we have to hold hands?

The toys LAUGH and SNICKER.

                         WOODY
            Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a
            big joke.  We've only got one week
            left before the move.  I don't want
            any toys left behind.  A moving
            buddy -- if you don't have one, get
            one!
                   (checking the pad)
            Alright, next...uh...oh, yes.
            Tuesday night's ""Plastic Corrosion
            Awareness"" meeting was, I think, a
            big success and we want to thank Mr.
            Spell for putting that on for us.
            Thank you, Mr. Spell.

The words ""You're welcome"" scroll across Mr. Spell's display
screen as he speaks.

                         MR. SPELL
            You're welcome.

                         WOODY
            Ok, uh...oh yes.  One minor note
            here...
                   (under his breath)
            Andy's birthday party's been moved
            to today.
                   (full voice)
            Next we have --

The toys all PANIC.

                         REX
            What?!  Whadda ya mean, the party's
            today?!  His birthday's not 'til
            next week!!

                         HAMM
            What's going on down there?  Is Mom
            losing her marbles?!

                         WOODY
            Well, obviously she wanted to have
            the party before the move.  I'm not
            worried.  You shouldn't be worried.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            Of course Woody ain't worried!
            He's been Andy's favorite since
            kindergarten!

                         SLINKY
            Hey, hey!  Come on, Potato Head!
            If Woody says it's all right, then,
            well, darnit, it's good enough for
            me.  Woody has never steered us
            wrong before.

While Slinky speaks, Potato Head takes off his mouth and
mimes kissing his own butt.

                         WOODY
            C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and
            birthday we go through this.

            But what if Andy gets another
            dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just
            don't think I can take that kind of
            rejection.

                         WOODY
            Hey, listen, no one's getting
            replaced.  This is Andy we're
            talking about.

Woody steps down from the podium and walks towards the crowd.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            It doesn't matter how much we're
            played with.  What matters is that
            we're here for Andy when he needs
            us.  That's what we're made for.
            Right?
Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.

                         HAMM
            Pardon me.  I hate to break up the
            staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE!
            Birthday guests at three o'clock!

                         WOODY
            Stay calm, everyone!!

Too late.  The toys PANIC and stampede over Woody towards
the bedroom window, leaving him alone on the floor.

                         WOODY
            Uh, meeting adjourned.

The toys all crowd around the bedroom window, trying to get
a peek outside.

                         HAMM
            Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at
            all those presents?!

                         MR. POTATO HEAD
            I can't see a thing!

Unable to see over the crowd, Potato Head pulls his eyes out
of his head and holds them up over the other toys.

ANGLE: TOY'S POV OF ANDY'S FRONT YARD

CHILDREN file towards the front door carrying presents.

                         HAMM
            Yessir, we're next month's garage
            sale fodder for sure.

                         REX
                   (panicked)
            Any dinosaur-shaped ones?

                         HAMM
            Ah, for crying out loud, they're
            all in boxes, you idiot!

The presents keep coming.

                         REX
            They're getting bigger.

                         SLINKY
            Wait!  There's a nice little one
            over there!

At first, the kid's present appears to be a little box, but
then the kid turns -- the present is four feet long.  The
toys SCREAM.

                         MR. SPELL
            Spell the word ""trashcan.""

                         REX
            We're doomed!

Down on the floor, Woody smacks his hand to his forehead in
surrender.

                         WOODY
            Alright!  Alright!

The toys turn inside and look down at Woody.

                         WOODY
                   (continued)
            If I send out the troops, will you
            all calm down?

                         REX
            Yes!  Yes!  We promise!

                         WOODY
            Okay, save your batteries!

                         HAMM
            Eh, very good, Woody.  That's using
            the old noodle.

Woody jumps up onto Andy's bed and turns to the Sargent on
the nightstand.

                         WOODY
            Sargent.  Establish a recon post
            downstairs.  Code red.  You know
            what to do.

                         SARGENT
            Yes SIR!

The green army man hops down to the floor where a ""BUCKET O'
SOLDIERS"" sits.

                         SARGENT
            Alright men, you heard him.  Code
            Red!  Repeat: We are at Code Red!
            Recon plan Charlie.  Execute!
            Let's move move move!!

THE GREEN ARMY MEN file out of the bucket and march in
formation across the bedroom floor.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Andy's door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forth
to make sure the coast is clear.  Satisfied, he motions for
the others to proceed.  Squads of soldiers march into the
hall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope.

The army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and
hold their positions while the Sargent surveys the scene
below through his binoculars.

ANGLE: SARGENT'S BINOCULAR VIEW OF DOWNSTAIRS

Directly below, Mrs. Davis passes through the hallway
rounding up Andy and all his birthday guests.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Okay, c'mon kids!  Everyone in the
            living room.  It's almost time for
            the presents.

Once Mrs. Davis and the children are out of sight, the
Sargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal.

TWO PARATROOPERS jump out through the railing, parachuting
down to the floor below.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The paratroopers sweep the area with their plastic rifles,
then give the ""all clear"" sign.

The jump rope is lowered, and more soldiers rappel down.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

The toys race towards the nightstand where Woody has placed
the receiving half of the baby monitor.

                         WOODY
            And this --
                   (turning on the baby monitor)
            -- is how we find out what is in
            those presents.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

The green army men march in formation across the floor when
suddenly...

SFX: FOOTSTEPS

Can be heard approaching from behind the connecting kitchen
door.  Immediately the Sargent signals for his men to freeze
in their various classic action poses.

                         MRS. DAVIS (O.S.)
            Okay, who's hungry?  Here come the
            chips.  I've got Cool Ranch and
            Barbeque --

The door opens and Mrs. Davis' foot comes down hard on top
of a soldier.

                         MRS. DAVIS
            Owww!  What in the world -- ?  Oh,
            I thought I told him to pick these up.

With a sweep of her foot, she brushes the army men out of
her path and continues on to the living room.

INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM

                         REX
            Shouldn't they be there by now?
            What's taking them so long?!

                         WOODY
            Hey, these guys are professionals.
            They're the best.  C'mon, they're
            not lying down on the job.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

As soon as Mom is gone, the Sargent motions for his men to
proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the
living room.

The Sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to
drag himself forward -- a casualty of Mrs. Davis' foot.  The
Sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet.

                         WOUNDED SOLDIER
                   (moans)
            Go on without me.  Just go!

                         SLINKY
            A good soldier never leaves a man
            behind.

The Sargent motions to the remaining men above.  They lower
themselves via jump rope, riding the baby monitor.  Once
downstairs, they hustle the baby monitor towards the
houseplant.  Suddenly...

A BALL

bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps
and kid clamor.

The Sargent, supporting his wounded man, reaches the plant,
right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor.  They
conceal themselves in the house plant just before the
children run by.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS - HOUSE PLANT - CONTINUOUS

While the baby monitor is set in place, A MEDIC evaluates
the wounded soldier and gives the ""thumb's up"" signal.

The Sargent scans the party with his binoculars.

The pile of brightly wrapped gifts sits atop the living room
coffee table.

                         SARGENT (O.S.)

The toys perk up as STATIC suddenly emits from the baby
monitor.

The toys CHEER WITH RELIEF.

            Yeah, alright!!

Hamm gives Potato Head a congratulatory pat on the back,
sending his facial features flying.

            Hey, watch it!

The platoon is preparing to exit the plant when...

            Wait a minute.  Oooh, what do we
            have here?!

The Sargent lifts his binoculars back to his eyes.

another large present.

            It's a WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!!!

Rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it, making the
monitor drop to the floor.  The impact causes the batteries
to roll out.

                         REX
            Oh, no!

Woody falls limp in his spot on the bed just as...

Andy's bedroom door flies open and a flood of children's
feet rush in.

Woody is flung off Andy's pillow and slides, unnoticed, down
the gap between the bed and the back wall.

            Quick!  Make a space!  This is

            Oh, yeah!

The kids all run out as fast as they entered, SLAMMING THE

The toys slowly come to life and make their way toward the bed.

                         MR. POTATO HEAD

Woody crawls out from under the bed.  The toys are shocked
to discover him there.

            excited, that's all.  Too much cake
            and ice cream, I suppose.  It's
            just a mistake.

Woody climbs slowly up the side of the bed, peeking over the
edge.  His eyes widen at the sight of...

BUZZ LIGHTYEAR

We see Buzz as Woody does - an expensive looking space age
action figure, covered with buttons and stickers from head
to toe.  The imposing ""G.I. Joe-sized"" doll stands heroically
in the center of the bed, his back to Woody.

Woody GULPS.

Buzz comes alive and looks around.

While he scans the bedroom a ""DARTH VADER"" LIKE BREATHING is
heard.

Buzz eyes it all suspiciously and pushes a button on his chest.

SFX: ELECTRONIC BEEP

                         BUZZ
            Buzz Lightyear to Star Command.
            Come in, Star Command.

Nothing.  He pushes the button again.

                         BUZZ
            Star Command - come in.  Do you
            read me?
                   (to himself)
            Why don't they answer?!!
Just then, Buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging.  The
box is designed to look like a spaceship.

                         BUZZ
                   (GASP)
            My ship!!

He runs up to the box and investigates the damage.

                         BUZZ
            Blast!  This'll take weeks to repair!

Buzz flips open a plastic compartment on his arm -- his
wrist communicator.

EXT. SPACE

A small planet glows in the light of its sun. Suddenly, we
hear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic mist behind
the planet... Then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the
planet, and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction.
Almost like somebody, or something, is eating it.

                                                   PUSH DOWN TO:

EXT. THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE

Strange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a
wild panic. It looks like Pompeii must have looked as
Vesuvius erupted.

ANGLE ON ONE OF THE CREATURES - TRACKING

The creature is KRANIX. We will meet him later on in a very
different context, but for now, he is running from the ever-
growing mist that threatens to engulf him.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PANIC

As Kranix runs, another creature, ARBLUS, calls to him.

                       ARBLUS
             Transform and flee, Kranix! You must
             warn all you meet of the horror of
             Unicron! Suddenly, the pitiful creature
             is surrounded by the strange energy cloud
             and it looks like his body has
             simultaneously caught fire and been
             doused with acid.

                        KRANIX
             Arblus!   No!

ANGLE ON KRANIX

The mist threatens to engulf him too. He transforms into a
small rocket ship and...

TRACK WITH KRANIX AS...

He takes off. As we rise higher and higher in the atmosphere,
we see the horror wrought by the hideous and still mysterious
Unicron. The planet cracks like an egg and rivers of lava
leak out. The energy cloud surrounds it and... Dissolves
everything... ... And when the smoke clears, we get our
first look at Unicron. It is horrifying. A massive, metal orb
with a gaping maw and a field of electricity.

MOONS ORBITING CYBERTRON IN DEEP SPACE

There are TWO MECHANISTIC MOONS orbiting the huge planet
Cybertron. But we are most concerned with a small, greenish
metal one.

                    NARRATOR
          It is the year 2005. The treacherous
          Decepticons have conquered the Autobots'
          home planet of Cybertron. But from
          secret staging grounds on two of
          Cybertron's moons the valiant Autobots
          prepare to retake their homeland.

CLOSER ON GREEN MOON

At first, we see nothing unusual or suspicious. Then,
pulling closer, we see that the top of the moon is covered
with moon camouflage ""netting"" and underneath it is a huge
cache of futuristic weapons. This is the Autobot staging
ground for an assault on Cybertron. DOLLY THROUGH THE COMPLEX
until we arrive at a Command Center where several Autobots
peer into monitors, running constant surveillance on
Cybertron.

ANGLE ON IRONHIDE

He peers into a monitor. As he speaks, we see the monitor
PAN to an area where a huge Decepticon Symbol is emblazoned
on Cybertron.

                    IRONHIDE
          Every time I look into this thing, my
          circuits sizzle. I'm tired of this
          waiting game, Prime. When are we gonna
          start bustin' Deceptichops?

ANGLE ON OPTIMUS PRIME

He stands over a holographic map which shows various invasion
plans for Cybertron.

                    OPTIMUS PRIME
          We still don't have enough Energon cubes
          to power a full scale assault, Ironhide.

                    IRONHIDE
          Then let me make another run to Autobot
          City on Earth. I'll bring you back more
          cubes than you'll know what to do with.

                                                              3.



ANGLE ON PRIME

He solemnly hands down an order

                     PRIME
           Alright, ready the shuttle for launch.

ANGLE ON IRONHIDE

He raises a fist in a warwhoop!

                     IRONHIDE
           YAHOO!
               (looking into monitor)
           Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps.

A SMALL MOON ""MOUNTAIN""

Ironhide transforms and Races toward a mountain, which stands
about a half mile from the secret Autobot facility.

                       OPTIMUS PRIME (V.O.)
           Jazz,    report security status.

                     JAZZ
           No sign of Decepticons in this sector,
           Prime.

                     JAZZ
           Jazz to Moon Base 2.

PAN UP   and through the sky to -

                      ANOTHER MOON
           This is the second moon. It is much
           closer to Cybertron than the first one.
           This is where Bumblebee and Spike are
           stationed.

                     JAZZ (V.O.)
           Jazz to Moon Base 2.

ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE

They stand together a communication console. Spike is now
35 years old. Bumblebee looks as he has always looked, save
for a couple of funny bumper stickers on his tail: I (heart)
Cybertron. I (club) Decepticons.

              Hey,   Ironhide, tell my son, Daniel, I
              miss   him, and tell him I'll be coming
              home   as soon as we've kicked Megatron's
              tail   across the galaxy.

THE   LUNAR    ""MOUNTAIN""

Suddenly, smoke starts pouring out of the mountain.

                          CLIFFJUMPER
              One....

Then, the ""mountain"" which must be made of paper mache or
something blows away revealing -- The shuttle!

                          CLIFFJUMPER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              Liftoff.

Suddenly, the shuttle rips out of the ground in a ball of
fire.

CONTINUED:

As it takes off, we realize this isn't any dinky shuttle, but
a massive ship, capable of carrying all the energon needed
to fight a war and an army to boot. The screen is bathed in
smoke and fire which slowly clears.

ANGLE ON PRIME

As he watches the shuttle shoot into the distance.

                       PRIME
             Now, all we need is a little Energon and
             a lot of luck.

ANGLE BEHIND PRIME

We see a bank of computers. Suddenly, a small tape deck pops
open... a cassette pops out and transforms into...
...Laserbeak who flies away unseen.

             Autobot city in one piece.

             sure as shootin' dodge a couple of
             asteroids.

Suddenly, there is a terrible BANG! on the side of the ship,
and the two Autobots are thrown from their seats.

                       PROWL
             You were saying?

                       IRONHIDE (IRKED)
             That wasn't an asteroid. There is a blast
             of light and they turn to see...

ANGLE ON THE SHIP

The most powerful laser light anybody has ever seen cuts a
gaping hole in the side of the ship... Then, when the light
clears, a panel of the ship falls in and we see -

MEGATRON!

In all his glory.

                      MEGATRON
            Die Autobots!

Then, he transforms to Gun Mode, spins into STARSCREAM'S arms
and Starscream fires.

                      BRAWN
            is cut in half by Megatron's blast.

            ...eat away at the hole in the shuttle to
            make way for... ...an ARMY of other
            Decepticons including Laserbeak who
            enter, firing.

IRONHIDE AND RATCHET

While FIRING back are FUSED TOGETHER... ... then blasted
apart and fall in smoking, glowing fragments.

ON STARSCREAM AND MEGATRON

As they enter the now empty ship, a number of Decepticons
flood past them, taking positions and searching for other
living Autobots.

                      MEGATRON
            This was almost too easy, Starscream.

                       STARSCREAM
            Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than
            attacking the real threat: the Autobots
            moon base.

                      MEGATRON
            You're an idiot, Starscream. Were we
            simply to wipe out that minuscule base,
            they could build another one.

          vanquished forever!

                    IRONHIDE
          Fat chance, Megatron!

Ironhide pulls himself up and grabs onto Megatron who flings
him against the wall.

                    MEGATRON
          Such heroic nonsense!

                    ON DANIEL
          Daniel, a classic twelve year old
          American boy watches the portable viewer
          which is like an over-sized Boy Scout
          compass. WIDEN SHOT to show he is at an
          old fashioned ""fishin' hole"" on Earth -
          surrounded by weeping willows, assorted
          trees and shrubs, and that his fishing
          pole is stuck in the dirt, the line
          floating lazily out on the water.

          Let's watch Ironhide land it, Hot Rod! As

          Hurry or we'll miss it!

                    HOT ROD
          lopes up hill after Daniel.

                    HOT ROD (CONT'D)
          If you're gonna ride, Dan-O ...ride in
          style! Hot Rod catches up with Daniel,
          scoops him off his hoverboard, TRANSFORMS
          to automotive mode and RIDES OVER CREST
          OF HILL with Daniel in the front seat.

ANOTHER ANGLE - ON AUTOBOT CITY

FOLLOW Hot Rod up and over a roadway leading around the
perimeter of Autobot City which becomes visible the instant
Hot Rod clears the rim of a hill. As they travel, we SHOULD
also be getting a sense of what Autobot City is all about.
(DESIGN NOTE: Autobot City looks like a federal energy
project gone mad. Here, the Autobots are trying to exploit
every known means of getting energy. The mountain is covered
with solar panels, windmills spin in the valley, oil derricks
pump, and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions
of volts. Near all of these various things are energon
compressors, which turn the raw energy into energon cubes. IN
THE BACKGROUND of these scenes, we should see various panel
truck-type Autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this
energon, convert to humanoid mode, load up their vans, then
convert to Auto mode again and drive the Energon into Autobot
City. In short, it should be clear that the purpose of
Autobot City is to harvest energy. All the while, Hot Rod and
Daniel are riding recklessly out from the Autobot City and up
into neighboring hills for an overview of the -

CIRCULAR LANDING AREA

which resides within the ""bowl"" created by the City structure
and natural surroundings.

                     DANIEL
          Hey!   Let me out.

ON KUP AND OTHER AUTOBOTS

KUP - a grizzled, ""old Soldier"" of an Autobot - is directing
the positioning of a large metal road barricade. Hot Rod
barrels through a sign which reads: ""STOP -THIS AREA OFF

DANIEL'S P.O.V - BINOCULAR MATTE - THE SHUTTLE

The hole Megatron blasted in order to get into the shuttle

Hot Rod looks up and a pair of futuristic binoculars pop out
of his eyes.

HOT ROD'S POV - THE SHUTTLE

Hot Rod's vision, now, infinitely better than human vision,
spots something truly disturbing -- -- Starscream, and
several Constructicons inside the ship!

43	15 Minutes	John Hertzfield	Action,Crime,Thriller		"FADE IN

	on the words CZECH AIRLINE.  We are panning across the words
	on the side of the plane.

	INT. AIRPLANE

	ANGLE DOWN

	on a tray table.  Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it. 
	Hands are counting the money.  The airline hostess announces
	the arrival at JFK - in CZECH.  A hand reaches into a breast
	pocket - pulling out two passports.  One is opened.  Belongs
	to EMIL SLOVAK.  The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL. 
	The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to
	him.  We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a
	small disposable camera on Oleg's tray table.  The passport
	is set down.  Oleg picks it up.  We hear Emil's voice in
	CZECH.  The scene is subtitled in ENGLISH.

				EMIL (V.O.)
		Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I
		say.  Don't open your mouth.

				OLEG (V.O.)
		Okay.

	INT. PASSPORT CONTROL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

	CAMERA DOLLIES down a long line of passengers.  They are
	split into two lines - one for Americans, the other for
	visitors.  CAMERA finally arrives at EMIL SLOVAK.  An
	unshaven Czech in his mid-30's.  Tall, scraggly beard. 
	Piercing blue eyes.  He's dressed in an outdated suit.  His
	eyes are alert, cunning and smart.

	OLEG RAZGUL, stands in line behind Emil.  Oleg is big.  Not
	tall - but wide.  A wrestler's body.  Emil looks at Oleg. 
	(The following is in CZECH and subtitled in ENGLISH.)

				EMIL
		Don't fool around.

				OLEG
		Okay.

	Oleg holds up his disposable camera - at arms length - to
	take a picture of himself.

				EMIL
		Did you hear what I said?

				OLEG
		I want to document my trip to America.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Next.
			(Emil steps up)
		Could I see your documents, please?

				EMIL
		Yes sir.

	He hands the passport to the officer who runs it through an
	image swipe.  Emil glances furtively back to Oleg.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		What is your intended purpose of your
		visit to the United States?

				EMIL
		Two weeks holiday.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		How much money are you carrying with
		you?

				EMIL
		I have five-hundred dollars.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the
		FIS area!

	Oleg was about to take a picture of Emil and the Immigration
	Officer.  Oleg puts the camera away.  Smiles sheepishly.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
			(to Emil)
		Is he with you?  Are you travelling
		together?

				EMIL
		Yes.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Please join us.
			(to Oleg)
		Come on forward.

				EMIL
		Is there a problem?

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		No, you're travelling together.  I want
		to talk to you together.  Hi, how are
		you?  Can I take a look at your
		documents?
			(takes Oleg's passport)
		Are you related?

				OLEG
		Yes...he's my friend.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Okay.  You're a Czech national and
		you're a Russian national.  How do you
		know one another?

	Oleg starts to speak, but Emil cuts him off.

				EMIL
		We are both from Prague.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
			(to Oleg)
		How long are you planning to stay?

				EMIL
		Two weeks.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		I'd like to speak for himself, okay?

				EMIL
		He doesn't speak English.

				OLEG
		I speak English.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
			(to Oleg)
		Then answer my questions.  Where were
		you planning to stay during the two
		weeks that you're here?

				OLEG
		New York.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Yes, we're in New York now.  But where
		are you planning to stay in New York?

				OLEG
		A cheap hotel.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		What are you coming here to do?

				OLEG
		I'm here for movies.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Movies...to be in the movies or to see
		movies?

				OLEG
		Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I
		see movie at school called ""It's a
		Wonderful Life"" directed by Frank Capra. 
		Ever since I want to come to America. 
		Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A
		land where anyone can be anything. As
		long as they are white.

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Excuse me?

				EMIL
		He made joke, bad joke.  First time on
		airplane...

	The SUPERVISOR comes over to see what the problem is:

				IMMIGRATION OFFICER
		Well, they've got valid visas, but they
		don't have much money.  Uh... and I'm
		not...uh, I think there's a possibility
		they may be coming to live and reside.

				SUPERVISOR
		Look how long the line is.  We gotta
		move 'em out.  I'll take them down to
		secondary.

	Emil looks at Oleg, pissed.

	INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	The place is empty except for one table at the end of the
	bar.  EDDIE FLEMMING, Manhattan's most famous detective, and
	his savvy, black partner, LEON JACKSON are having cocktails. 
	Eddie is smoothly handsome, tough, smart and tired.  Not only
	is he the best homicide detective Manhattan has ever seen,
	he's continually mentioned in New York columns and has been
	the subject of several magazine articles.  There's even been
	a TV movie about one of his biggest cases.  Leon has been
	with Eddie a long time and was also featured in the TV movie.

	Sitting with Eddie and Leon is ROBERT HAWKINS, host and star
	reporter for the tabloid show, ""Top Story.""  Hawkins is also
	the best in the business and has dealt with them all: Joey
	Buttafuco and Amy Fisher, Lorena Bobbit and OJ.

	Wait staff bustles in the b.g. doing the morning set up. 
	Hawkins listens as Eddie, cigar in hand, finishes a ""war
	story"" and a vodka tonic at the same time.

				EDDIE
		So we're waitin' to hit this warrant -
		we got Emergency Service with the heavy
		weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I
		say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I
		go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the
		sudden I turn around and a kid with a
		shotgun let one go.  Right where I was
		standin'.  That coulda been it.  I
		coulda had my head blown off and for
		what?  Some stupid kid got panicky,
		takes the safety off and it's over.  If
		I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for
		a bad habit - I would've had my head
		blown off.

				HAWKINS
		Jesus Christ.

	PAULIE, the owner, walks up.

				PAULIE
		Speakin' of bad habits, everybody okay?

				HAWKINS
		Another martini.

				LEON
		Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.

				EDDIE
		Vodka tonic.

				LEON
			(rethinks it)
		Maybe you could just put in a shot of
		Martell?

	Paulie takes the drinks off the table and an empty bottle of
	vodka.

				LEON (CONT'D)
			(of Eddie's story)
		It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid
		kid.

				EDDIE
		What's the kid gonna say - sorry? 
		Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. 
		Like last week - we were at the morgue
		and this guy was all chopped up - spleen
		here - liver there - his heart in a pan. 
		Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his
		dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who
		knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3
		or some shit and shot him and now you
		can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a
		human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. 
		Sooner or later.  That's me.  

				HAWKINS
		Sooner or later that's everybody.  

				EDDIE
		Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like
		that.  I mean, what do I got left? 
		Coupla articles.  A medal or two. 
		Plaque here and there and in a coupla
		years no one remembers me anymore.

				HAWKINS
		I think you're getting a little moody
		there, Eddie.

				EDDIE
		I'm not moody.

	Hawkins and Leon share a look.

				HAWKINS
		Isn't he a little moody?

				LEON
		Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in
		love.

				HAWKINS
		In love?  With who?

	Paulie delivers the drinks and sets some cigars on the table. 
	Takes a seat next to Eddie.  Eddie asks Hawkins.

				EDDIE
		How old are your kids?

				HAWKINS
		My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. 
		Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're
		thinking about having a kid!  How old
		are you?  Never mind. 
		Let me just tell you this: Every stupid
		cliche you hear about kids - they change
		your life, they make you a better
		person, they make you whole...
			(beat)
		It's all true!  Before I had kids when
		friends talked about their kids, I
		wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I
		right, Leon?

				LEON
		Absomotherfuckin'lutely.  You can have
		all three of my ex-wives.  But somebody
		so much as looks sideways at my four
		girls -- I'd kill 'em.  
			(takes out his wallet)
		You haven't seen my youngest have you?

	As he hands pictures to Hawkins his cell phone rings.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		Yeah?

				HAWKINS
		Paulie, you've got kids, right?

				PAULIE
		My kids don't talk to me anymore but
		they were great when they were young.

				LEON
			(into the phone)
		Sure it's him?  Great!
			(collapses the phone)
		Unique's home.

	They all rise from the table.

				EDDIE
		Paulie, I need the cure.

				PAULIE
		Step into my office.

	Leon and Hawkins sit back down as Eddie and Paulie leave.

				HAWKINS
		So you got your kids listening to Opera? 
		You still singing in the church on the
		weekends?

	INT. SECONDARY IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY

	Now other officers are questioning Emil and Oleg.  They've
	been there a while.  The SECONDARY OFFICER is looking Oleg.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I
		understand that.
			(to Emil)
		And what kind of work do you do?

				EMIL
		I am butcher.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		You're a butcher?  What do you use pig
		intestines for?

				EMIL
		You stuff sausage in it.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		And what do you do with the bones?

				EMIL
		Dog food.

	Emil looks at Oleg.  Blaming his stupid responses at Passport
	Control for their detainment.

				SECONDARY OFFICER
		Are you married?

				EMIL
		No.  Are you proposing?

	ANGLE UP

	through a thousand ICE CUBES.  A face plunges towards us...

	INT. MENS ROOM

	Eddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink
	full of ice.  He dries his face, looks into his bloodshot
	eyes.  Presents a small black ring box to the mirror.

				EDDIE
		Will you marry me?  Wanna get married? 
		What are you doin' Saturday?

	Leon enters.  Eddie turns.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		I'm gonna propose.

				LEON
		When?

				EDDIE
		Tomorrow.  At lunch.

				LEON
		You ready?

	Eddie leans back and drops some Visine in his eyes.  Turns.

				EDDIE
		The thrill of the hunt.  I love it.

	EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

	Oleg and Emil stare at the bright lights - all the nonstop
	action.  Each stands with an old suitcase.

				OLEG
			(in Russian)
		Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the
		movies!

				EMIL
			(in Czech)
		Don't speak Russian!

				OLEG
			(in Russian)
		Why?  Why do I always have to speak to
		you in Czech?

				EMIL
			(in Czech)
		Because I don't like your ugly language. 
		I heard enough of it in school!  Now
		speak Czech or English.  And don't fool
		around anymore.  You almost got us
		thrown out!

	Emil pulls out an envelope with Milos' address on it.  This
	is who they came to see.  Emil hails a CAB.  Oleg is staring
	inside a camera store - at himself on a monitor.  A
	videocamera's pointed out in the street.

				OLEG
		Look.  New videocameras.  Color
		viewfinder.  Image stabilization. 
		Solarization.  Night vision.

				EMIL
		We have no money.  Come on.

	Oleg stares at the videocamera - dying to have one like this. 
	Emil slides into the cab.

				CABBIE
		Where you wanna go, buddy?

	Emil pulls out the post-marked envelope.  Points to the
	return address on it and passes it through the slot to the
	Cabbie.

				EMIL
		Here.

	Emil looks out the window - no sign of Oleg.  Then, Oleg
	hurries out the camera store, gripping something inside his
	coat.  He flings both suitcases in the trunk, SLAMS it shut 
	and jumps in the back seat.  He opens his jacket - pulling
	out the VIDEOCAMERA he just stole.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Go!

	Oleg smiles sheepishly at Emil.
		

	EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - DAY

	Eddie's car pulls up.  Eddie, Leon and Hawkins get out.

				HAWKINS
		So what's unique?

				EDDIE
		Not what.  Who.

	Eddie passes Hawkins a Polaroid - of a woman on a bed -
	covered in blood.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was
		taking too long to put her make-up on. 
		they were late for a party.  Stabbed her
		with a beer bottle.

				HAWKINS
		That's unique.

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  And he still went to the party.

	Leon moves to a LOOKOUT - gives him a twenty.

				LOOKOUT
		Top floor.  Back room.

				EDDIE
		Yeah.  I make big cases, they make the
		news and I look good.  But the problem
		with becoming a star is downtown.  They
		shoot at stars.  Now be quiet.  Shhh.

	As they reach the doorway - Eddie surprises two crackheads. 
	Waves them off.  They hurry away.

				EDDIE (CONT'D)
		I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees
		are killing me.  Stay behind me.

				HAWKINS
		You're worried for my safety.  I'm
		touched.

	Eddie flattens against the building - watches Unique descend
	the fire escape.

				HAWKINS (CONT'D)
		Ready?

				EDDIE
		Keep them out of my way.

				HAWKINS
		Okay.  You ready?

				EDDIE
		Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.

	Eddie closes in.

				HAWKINS
			(into his cell phone)
		COME ON!  COME ON!  YOU FUCKING GUYS,
		LET'S MOVE IT!

	Unique is climbing down the fire escape - before he gets to
	the bottom, Leon bursts through a door behind him and kicks
	the fire escape, sending Unique flying into the alley.  Where
	he lands dropping his gun.

	Eddie pulls him off the ground as Leon scoops the gun up.

				EDDIE
		What's your rush?  Going to a party?

				UNIQUE
		Why you chasin' me, man?

				EDDIE
		I don't know.  You always come outta
		your house that way?

				UNIQUE
		It's not my house, man.  I don't live
		here.

				EDDIE
		Well, sounds like burglary to me.

	Leon cuffs Unique who recognizes Eddie.

				UNIQUE
		I know you man.

	An unmarked van comes tearing into the scene.  Disgorges a
	mini-cam team that starts filming but they missed the bust.

				HAWKINS
			(to Eddie)
		Any chance we can do that again?

				EDDIE
		Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first
		time.
						

	EXT. EAST SIDE - LATE DAY

	The cab is in front of an old five-story brownstone.  Oleg
	gets the bags out of the trunk as Emil tucks the envelope
	into his jacket, then steps up to the old building.  He looks
	back at Oleg - who's VIDEOTAPING him.

				EMIL
		Turn that off!  Get the bags.

				OLEG
		Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a
		dog.

				EMIL
		For five years I paid for your
		stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the
		rest of my life if I say so.
			(challenging)
		Unless you refuse, Oleg.

	Oleg looks at Emil.  Even though Oleg is stronger than Emil,
	he fears him.  He picks up both bags.  Emil searches the
	occupant list over the buzzers to the apartment building.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		There.  5RW.

	Emil pushes ten of the buzzers except 5RW.  A BUZZER clicks
	and Emil pushes it open.

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DAY

	The brownstone has no elevator so Emil and Oleg climb the
	stairs... Oleg cradling his camera.  Emil notices a crack
	pipe on the floor and picks it up.  Smells the bowl.

				OLEG
		What?

				EMIL
		Smell like chemicals...for smoking
		drugs.

	Emil pockets the pipe and climbs to the top floor, moving
	down the dirty hallway to a corner door.

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

	He KNOCKS...FOOTSTEPS approach.  The door is opened by MILOS -
	a 40-year-old Czech, dressed in stained plumbers overalls. 
	He  is surprised to see Emil and Oleg in his doorway.  Oleg
	films him...

				MILOS
		Emil???!

				EMIL
		Surprise!  Surprise!

	Milos shoots a look across the tiny kitchen to TAMINA, his
	comely wife.

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

	Emil pushes his way inside.  Oleg follows.  Milos wears
	plumbers overalls but Emil notices sports a Rolex.  Tamina
	has on a faded dress but despite their cheaply furnished
	apartment she wears an expensive brushed gold necklace,
	bracelet and big pearl earrings.  The room is furnished with
	kitsch from Disney World and Las Vegas.  The only anomaly is
	a HUGE SONY TRINITRON HOME ENTERTAINMENT CENTER.  (The
	following is in Czech and subtitled in English.)

				EMIL
		Your sister said she didn't know where
		you were so you shouldn't write to her
		with return address if you're hiding. 

				MILOS
		Did you hurt her?

				EMIL
		You know me...I never hurt anybody. 
		Where's the money?

				OLEG
		Hello, Tamina.

	Oleg is looking Tamina over.  Milos - though scared - barks
	at Oleg.

				MILOS
		Take your eyes off her, Oleg!
			(to Emil)
		Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were
		caught.
			(of Oleg)
		It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank
		clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going
		to wait!!!

				EMIL
		Milos.  Get my money!

	Oleg videotapes the scene.

	CLOSE ON AN AJAR DOOR

	All we see behind it is a WOMAN'S FACE and her wet hair - she
	obviously came from the shower and we see the towel wrapped
	around her.

				MILOS
			(nervously)
		We spent it!

				EMIL
		Ha. Ha.

				MILOS
		Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. 
		You think I'd be working if I had
		money?!

	Emil, pissed, moves to a wood block and pulls out a KITCHEN
	KNIFE.  He grabs Tamina roughly, putting the blade to her
	throat.

				MILOS (CONT'D)
		Emil.  Put down the knife.

	Milos looks at his wife - who is terrified.

				MILOS (CONT'D)
		Emil.  I'll help you.

	Milos closes the gap between him and Emil - trying to calm
	him by talking softly.

				MILOS (CONT'D)
		I can get you a job.

				EMIL
		A job?

				MILOS
		Yes, the money is good.

				EMIL
		As a plumber?!

				MILOS
		It's easy to learn.

				EMIL
		A job??  As a plumber???  You think I
		come to America to work!

				MILOS
		We started over, you can too.

				EMIL
			(furious)
		You spent all the money while I was in
		prison?  Now you tell me to get a job
		fixing toilets?!?

	Emil pulls the knife away from Tamina - then angrily PLUNGES
	it toward Milos' chest!

	Oleg videotapes it.  Then lowers the camera - shocked that
	Emil killed Milos.

	Blood sprays Tamina's face.  She tries to run but Oleg grabs
	her, not noticing her brushed gold bracelet falls to the
	floor.  He covers her mouth as he points the videocamera at
	Emil who STABS Tamina - absolutely enraged!

	THE WOMAN BEHIND THE DOOR

	flees...Emil hears NOISE in the bedroom - a window opening. 
	Emil kicks the bedroom door open.  Sees the window leading to
	the fire escape.  He dashes to it.  Sees four flights down -
	the WOMAN, wearing a summer dress.  Barefoot.  Her hair still
	wet.  

	She looks up.  She is beautiful and terrified.  She runs
	down the alley.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		She saw!

	Emil hurries toward the bathroom.  She just got out of the
	shower.  Her underwear and purse are draped over a chair. 
	Emil grabs the purse.  Finds a CZECHOSLOVAKIAN PASSPORT.  He
	opens the cover, stares at her photo and name.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Daphne Hanlova.

	There's one stamp in the passport - from the U.S. when she
	arrived - June 16, 1998.  Underneath is written - 6 MONTH
	STAY.  Emil flips through the rest of the passport - all
	blank pages.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Six month visa.  Still here two years
		later.  They'll deport her if she goes
		to Police.

	Emil pockets Daphne's passport and wallet, scoops up her
	shoes and jacket - enters the kitchen and dumps them on the
	floor.  He tears through the kitchen cabinets, throwing cans
	and bottles aside.

				OLEG
		What are you looking for?

	Emil finds nail polish remover - looks at the bodies.

				EMIL
		I'm going to make a bohemian barbecue.

	Emil draws the kitchen curtains plunging the room into
	darkness.
		
		EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

	A face comes from the darkness.  It's an athletically
	handsome man, jogging out of a tunnel towards us.  He's in a
	tie and jacket in Central Park at NIGHT. 
	He is JORDAN (JORDY) WARSAW.  A sensitive man of rugged
	honesty.  He runs down the hill in a hurry.  A MUGGER steps
	in his path.

				MUGGER
		Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare
		twenty?

				JORDY
		Look, I don't have time for you, get out
		of my way!!

				MUGGER
		Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin'
		money?

	The Mugger pulls a knife - and in a whirl of movement, Jordy
	grabs his wrist and disarms him in a deadly, professional
	manner - hurling him down to the pavement, twisting his arm
	behind his back.  With his other hand, Jordy whips out a
	BROWNING 9MM from his shoulder holster and places it behind
	the mugger's head.  Jordy displays his shield.

				JORDY
		Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you
		happy?

				MUGGER
		Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry
		guns.

				JORDY
		Oh yeah?  Guess again.

	Jordy handcuffs the Mugger and searches the Mugger's coat
	pockets - pulling out a handful of driver's licenses and
	credit cards.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		Nice - how many people you ripped off
		tonight?!  Get up!

	As Jordy yanks the Mugger to his feet, his BEEPER goes off.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		You couldn't listen to me, could you?

	Jordy drags the Mugger to a tree.  Cuffs him so his face is
	pressed up against the bark.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		I'll send a cop back for you.

				MUGGER
		Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like
		this.  Some freak'll come by and stab
		me!

	Jordy jogs off across the park.

				MUGGER (CONT'D)
		Wait!  Come back!!

	EXT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

	FIRE TRUCKS from three battalions.  Radios CRACKLE.  There's
	a crowd growing.  Jordy pushes his way through.  The top
	floor of the brownstone where Milos and Tamina lived has been
	reduced to smoking ruins.  The trees are covered in debris
	and soot.  Jordy moves to LOUIE - Battalion Chief.

				LOUIE
		Lieutenant - take up your line and
		relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top
		floor.

				JORDY
		Hey, Louie, were you first due?

				LOUIE
		Yeah, I radioed you guys right away
		'cause you got two roasts on the top
		floor but you don't hafta investigate
		cause homicide is up there.

				JORDY
		Homicide?  Who let them up?  I didn't
		make it a crime scene yet.

				LOUIE
		Hey, it's Eddie Flemming.

				KORFIN (O.S.)
		Yo, Jordy!

	BOBBY KORFIN - an overweight arson investigator with a quick
	with and good sense of humor - comes over, pulling on a
	turnout coat.

				KORFIN (CONT'D)
		Where you been, man?  We got a
		celebrity!

				JORDY
		I heard.  Who the hell let them up
		there?

				KORFIN
		I don't know, you think Eddie will give
		me his autograph?

				JORDY
		You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody
		suspicious?

				KORFIN
		Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.

				JORDY
		Oh yeah, why?

				KORFIN
		'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by
		now!

	INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The roof is gone.  The sky is exposed.  It's charred ruins,
	smoked beams and watery muck.  Eddie and Leon are standing by
	what's left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina's
	charred bodies.  Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar,
	listening to Leon.

				LEON
		So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine
		position - that they were doin' each
		other but were so whacked out of their
		heads they set the pipe on the mattress,
		lit it up, and they got fried.  What do
		you think, Eddie?

	Jordy enters - with Korfin who's carrying a paint can.

				EDDIE
		I don't know.  We got the experts here. 
		Show them what you found - I hope you
		don't mind, we came over to see if we
		could help.

	Korfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the
	celebrity.

				KORFIN
		Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming -
		Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with
		you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.

				JORDY
		Could you put out the cigar?  Part of
		the job is picking up scents.

				EDDIE
		Oh, sure.

	Eddie puts his cigar out.  Carefully slides it into a cigar
	holder and pockets it to finish later.

				LEON
		Well, I found - check it out - crack
		pipe.  Looks like they got careless.

	Leon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs.  Korfin
	shines the flashlight on Leon to look at the pipe.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		Mind not shining that light in my eyes?

				KORFIN
		Sorry, bro.

				JORDY
		Hey, that's great you guys got it all
		wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go
		through the routine?  It gives us
		somethin' to do.

				EDDIE
		No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?

				LEON
		No.  Go ahead.

				JORDY
		Thanks.  Appreciate it.

	Jordy throws a look at Korfin.  Homicide detectives have no
	respect for fire marshals' investigative skills.  Eddie
	rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and
	living room... Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a
	charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes.

				KORFIN
		Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got
		good patterns - about thirty minutes
		old.

	Jordy moves to one of the corpses.  He pulls on a white
	rubber glove.  Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth.  The
	glove comes out white.

				JORDY
		Mouth's clean, too.

				KORFIN
		Clean?

				JORDY
		Don't blow your nose!

	Jordy's looking at Leon, who was just about to blow his nose.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		The smoke'll permeate your nostrils -
		burn 'em out.  Let it run.

				KORFIN
		But you knew that, right?

	Leon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief.  Jordy
	turns back to the corpses on the bed.  Eddie - in the other
	room - has found Tamina's brushed gold bracelet on the floor.

				JORDY
		So the way you see it, two crack heads
		burned themselves up?

				LEON
		That's what it looks like to me.

				JORDY
		And while they're burning up, they're
		still goin' down on each other?  You got
		to hand it to them.

				LEON
			(realizes he's wrong - blows it
			 off)
		Yeah, well, some people got their
		priorities straight.

	Leon watches Jordy, quietly.  With a pair of tweezers, Jordy
	pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the
	heads.  Korfin supplies the paint can.  Jordy drops the cloth
	inside.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		What was that?

				JORDY
		Evidence.  Of a homicide.

	That got Eddie's attention and he comes back to the bedroom.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		You know what that is, right?

				EDDIE
		No, what is it?

				JORDY
		Why don't you explain it, Bobby.
			(to a fireman joking a wall)
		Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole
		in the floor?

				CAMELLO
		No problem.
			(to Eddie and Leon)
		Excuse me, gentlemen.  You might wanna
		back up a little more.  Don't wanna get
		your pants wet.

	Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV
	set.  Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon.  As Camello
	hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the
	bodies and Korfin explains:

				KORFIN
		They have not soot in their mouths,
		which means they weren't breathin'
		before the fire and that usually means
		they were deceased - and this piece of
		cloth that my partner found means they
		were wrapped up in something, probably
		doused with a flammable liquid and
		positioned like this on the bed.  To the
		untrained eye, it looks like an
		accident.

	Jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for
	something.

				LEON
		What's he looking for?

				EDDIE
		A timer.

	Jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up -
	on the other end is a timer.  Korfin takes the timer from
	Jordy and moves to Eddie.

				KORFIN
		Here you go.  A big double homicide.

	EXT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	As Jordy and Korfin exit the brownstone, a CAMERA CREW is
	arriving.  Jumps out. 
	Korfin and Jordy cross toward Korfin's car.  They open the
	trunk.  Take off their muddy boots throwing them in.

				KORFIN
		You see Eddie's face when I gave him the
		timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.

				JORDY
		He knew all along.

				KORFIN
		What??

				JORDY
		That's why he was so quiet.  He was
		testing us.

	Eddie and Leon exit - Eddie carrying a baggie with a timer
	inside.  NICOLETTE KARAS, young and attractive, pushes her
	microphone at Eddie.  She's smart, aggressive and respected
	by her peers.

				NICOLETTE
		Detective, does it look like a murder?

				EDDIE
		We don't know that yet.  It's much too
		early.  There's a lot to be done.

				NICOLETTE
		How many victims are up there?

				EDDIE
		There are two bodies found at this
		point.

				NICOLETTE
		Can we go up to the crime scene?

				EDDIE
		You know you can't do that.  C'mon.

				NICOLETTE
		Is it drug related?

				EDDIE
		We don't know.  When I have more I'll
		let you know.

	Nicolette signals for her camera man, MIKE, to zoom in on
	Eddie's hand.  She barrels on...

				NICOLETTE
		Detective...what's that you're holding
		in your hand?  Evidence?

	Mike pans up to Eddie's face.  Other reporters arrive,
	hurling questions which Eddie easily answers.  Cameras flash
	as we PAN BACK TO Korfin and Jordy.  Jordy is about to get in
	the car as he notices, back behind some construction - DAPHNE
	HANDLOVA.  She's still wearing the crumpled summer dress. 
	She tentatively steps out to signal Jordy.  He only catches a
	glimpse of her.  He starts toward her -- knifes through the
	crowd - but Daphne is gone.

				KORFIN
		What?

				JORDY
		There was a woman - I think she wanted
		to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh
		shit!  Oh no!

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER

	Korfin's car SCREECHES to a stop.  Jordy leaps out. 
	Suddenly, Jordy stops...the Mugger handcuffed to the tree is
	now NAKED!

				MUGGER
		You motherfuckin' bastard!  She stripped
		me!  It was a bag lady!  She touched me
		all over, it was disgusting.

	Jordy unlocks the handcuffs.

				JORDY
		I'm sorry.  I'm really sorry.

	Korfin delivers a blanket.  Jordy covers him.

				JORDY (CONT'D)
		You okay?

				MUGGER
		A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you
		for this!  You violated my civil rights!

				JORDY
		Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob
		me!  I could arrest you right now! 
		You're lucky you're walking away from
		this.  Now get outta here.

	Jordy gives him a push.  The Mugger wraps the blanket around
	himself cursing - hurrying away.
		

	EXT. 8TH AVENUE - NIGHT

	Exhausted HOOKERS who have worked all night loiter outside a
	sleazy hotel.  CAMERA PANS up to a blinking hotel sign.

	INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	The light is blinking an eerie green and yellow light into
	the room.  Emil is at the window pulling the blind down
	trying to shut out the blinking light.  He pulls it down
	twice and it pops back up both times.  The third time he
	angrily pulls it so hard, it comes off the window completely. 
	He sits down in a chair in frustration - adjusting a pillow
	behind his back.  THE ROSEANNE SHOW is on TV.  Roseanne has
	been talking to a FATHER.

				ROSEANNE (ON T.V.)
		So you slept with your son's wife! 
		What's that all about?

				FATHER (ON T.V.)
		I take full responsibility for sleepin'
		with my daughter in law.  I had low self
		esteem, I thought I had to compete with
		him.

	Emil reaches for his dictionary.

				EMIL
			(mutters)
		Self-esteem?  Self-esteem??

	He flips through his dictionary to find the meaning of self
	esteem.

				FATHER (ON T.V.)
		Losin' my job and everything, caused my
		behavioral disorder.
			(turns to his son)
		Forgive me, Kirk.  Let me hug you?

	The audience boos.  Roseanne mediates...

	Oleg - fresh from the shower with wet hair - sits on the bed
	in his skivvies - staring into the videocamera's LCD screen -
	rewinding Milos' murder.  We see it now for the first time -
	as he rewinds it.  Oleg watches - a bottle of cheap vodka
	between his legs.  Emil, looks up from his dictionary.  He's
	wearing Milos' Rolex. 
	Tamina's jewelry - her brushed gold necklace and pearl
	earrings - are in front of him with Daphne's wallet.  Emil
	looks up - Oleg is holding his videocamera.

				EMIL
			(Czech)
		Turn that fucking thing off!

				OLEG
			(Czech)
		I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos
		die.  It's just like a move but realer.

	Emil grabs the videocamera.
			(Czech)
		Don't break it!  Don't break it!

				EMIL
		Speak English!

				OLEG
			(English)
		You said speak Czech!

				EMIL
		How you erase this?

				OLEG
		I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!

	Emil tosses the camera back to Oleg who drops his vodka
	bottle in order to catch the camera.  Oleg, holding the
	camera like it's gold, goes to the dresser and puts it away. 
	Emil starts to go through Daphne's wallet.

				EMIL
		Stupid, Milos.  I didn't want to kill
		him.
			(noticing)
		What's this?

	Emil found the last card in the wallet.  It's pink with a
	picture of a busty globe.  Printed in the middle is - WORLDLY
	ESCORTS - and a number.

				EMIL (CONT'D)
		Worldly escorts?

	Emil picks up his dictionary and begins to flip the pages -
	finding the meaning of worldly.  He gets up and dials the
	number.  A soft, SEXY VOICE answers.  Soft music in the
	background.

				SEXY VOICE
		Hi?

				EMIL
		Hello?

				SEXY VOICE
		Are you looking for companionship?

	Oleg, who's listening, moves to Emil.

				OLEG
		Whore?

                                       PROF. WEST
                    How deep are we?
          
                                     SATNAM
                    8200 feet. Used to be an old copper
                    mine, Professor, sir.
          
          As Prof. West follows Satnam, he takes in the unusual setting
          for this science lab.
          
                                     PROF. WEST
                    Helmsley told me that the neutrino
                    count doubled during the last sun
                    eruptions.
          
                                     SATNAM
                    Correct, sir. But that is not what
                    worries me...
          
          They enter a large room with low hanging ceilings. A small
          group of WHITE COATS look up from their computers, which all
          show images of the solar storm we witnessed earlier.
          
                                     SATNAM (CONT'D)
                    There was a new solar storm, so strong
                    that the physical reaction got even
                    more severe.
          
                                       PROF. WEST
                    How can that be?
          
                                     SATNAM
                    We don't know, Professor, sir.
          
          Satnam walks over into another room. There he opens a hatch
          on the floor and hot steam rises.
          
                                     SATNAM (CONT'D)
                    The neutrinos suddenly act like...
                    microwaves.
          
          Prof. West slowly steps closer. When he discovers that the
          water in the tank below is boiling, his face goes pale.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
                                                                        3.
          
          EXT. LARGE TERRACE/WASHINGTON D.C. - EVENING
          
          A major fund raising party is under way. The setting is
          spectacular. A terrace overlooking the Washington Mall and
          the Capitol Building.
          
          ADRIAN HELMSLEY, 32, stands with a group of young POLITICAL
          AIDES. He is the only African-American among them.
          
          One of the aides spots CARL ANHEUSER, 58, White House Chief
          of Staff, working the crowd.
          
                                     POLITICAL AID #1
                    Look at Anheuser. Anyone would think he
                    was President. Did you hear, he wants
                    us to sign in and out like school boys?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    I still can't believe that Wilson chose
                    him of all people to run the White
                    House.
          
                                     POLITICAL AID #2
                    Why not? Anheuser owns the Senate and
                    the Congress.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Shame he's such a pompous ass.
          
                                     ANHEUSER (O.S.)
                    Somebody mention my name?
          
          Adrian turns to see Anheuser smiling.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                            (SHOCKED)
                    Yes sir... No, sir.
          
                                       ANHEUSER
                    Which one is it?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    We were talking about what a great
                    speech you gave tonight. Well done,
                    sir.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember
                    that.
          
          Anheuser walks away with a dangerous smile.
          
                                     POLITICAL AID #2
                    That guy scares the shit out of me.
          
          At that moment Adrian's cell phone rings.
                                                              (CONTINUED)

                            (into the phone)
                    Professor West?
          
                                     PROF. WEST (O.S.)
                    I've been trying to reach you!
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM/SATNAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Prof. West is on the phone. In the background we make out
          Satnam's family around the dining room table.
          
                                     PROF. WEST
                    Listen, Adrian. The situation is much
                    worse than we thought...
          
          Satnam quiets his little son. It is the boy we saw earlier
          with his toy ship.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY/WHITE HOUSE - DAY
          
          Adrian follows Anheuser through a hallway of the White House,
          papers in hand.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Sir, the President needs to know this.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Helmsley, how long have you been on the
                    job as science advisor?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Four months this week.
          
                                       ANHEUSER
                    I would   say that's enough time to learn
                    that we   have rules here. You'll just
                    have to   wait until the quarterly
                    science   briefing.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    If this is about what I said last
                    night, I am truly sorry, sir.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    So you didn't like my speech?
          
          Exasperated, Adrian holds out the papers to him.
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    Can you please have a look at this,
                    sir? It's really important.
          
          
                                                                (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                       5.
          
          Finally, Anheuser rips the papers out of his hands and starts
          to walk away, reading.
          
          Suddenly he slows down.
          
                                      ANHEUSER
                    Who wrote this?
          
                                     ADRIAN
                    An Indian astrophysicist I graduated
                    with from Harvard and Prof. West, the
                    preeminent geologist in the US.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Who else knows about it?
          
                                      ADRIAN
                    No one, sir.
          
                                     ANHEUSER
                    Let's keep it that way, Helmsley.
          
          Anheuser walks away.

          G8 Summit. Riot police control the unruly crowd with water
          cannons.
          
          We see PROTESTERS with Anti Globalization signs behind a
          fence. A convoy of limousines is approaching a historic
          building.
          
          
          INT. BIG HALL/ALHAMBRA - DAY
          
          We follow the American delegation into the conference room,
          where the other G8 delegations are seated around an enormous
          table.
          
          The President of the United States, THOMAS F. WILSON, 56,
          doesn't sit down. He addresses the room and everybody goes
          quiet.
          
                                      PRESIDENT WILSON (O.S.)
                    Good Morning...
          
          For the first time we see the President's face. He is African-
          American.
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    I hereby present a motion to meet
                    privately with my seven fellow Heads of
                    State, kindly excluding the rest of the
                    delegates.
          
          A murmur erupts. The Russian President SERGEY MAKARENKO, 62,
          whispers to one of his interpreters.
          
                                     RUSSIAN INTERPRETER
                    Mr. Makarenko wishes to have his
                    interpreters present.
          
          President Wilson looks over to the Russian Colleague.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON
                    Mr. President, judging from the
                    conversations we've had in the past, I
                    can assure you, your English is
                    absolutely fine, for what I have to
                    say.
          
          As the Russian President waves his interpreter away, all the
          international delegates leave as well.
          
          The huge doors of the hall close. A secret service officer in
          the sound booth switches off the recording equipment to the
          chamber.
          
          The President gathers himself.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    Six months ago I was made aware of a
                    situation so devastating, that at
                    first, I refused to believe it.
                            (PAUSE)
                    However through the concerted efforts
                    of the brightest scientists of several
                    nations, we have now confirmed its
                    validity.
          
          Dead silence.
          
                                     PRESIDENT WILSON (CONT'D)
                    The world as we know it, will soon come
                    to an end.

          A Chinese COLONEL, wearing dark sun glasses, watches from the

          monasteries.
          
                                     VOICE (O.S.)

          Someone speaks on a megaphone in the village square as
          villagers are evicted by soldiers and herded into trucks.
          
                                     VOICE (O.S.)

          NENG PANG, a young monk, 18, is loaded into a truck together

          EXT. SCHOOL/TIBET - DAY
          
          Neng's older brother, LIN PANG, 25, is part of a huge crowd
          of young men and women staying behind by a Tibetan school
          building. He turns and yells after the truck.
          
                                     LIN
                    I will send you money mother.
          
          The Colonel with the dark glasses steps up, addressing the

          In the BACKGROUND, a series of explosions punch enormous
          holes into the side of the mountain, showering rock
          everywhere.

          MANFRED PICARD, 63, head of the French National Museums,
          stands by LAURA, a young African-American woman in her late

          Laura answers in almost perfect French.
          
                                     LAURA
                    There are too many crazy people who
                    could hurt her, Manfred. The World

                    over the world.
          
          In the BACKGROUND the Mona Lisa is taken off the wall and
          replaced with a perfect replica. Picard still looks uneasy.
          He watches as the real Mona Lisa is sealed into an airtight
          case.
          
                                     MANFRED PICARD

          Picard looks suspicious but says nothing. The CAMERA MOVES IN
          on the face of the fake Mona Lisa until all we see is her
          mysterious smile.

          A small tremor rocks the apartment and the dishevelled face
          of JACKSON CURTIS, 33, pops up from behind the couch. He fell
          asleep at his laptop last night.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    Oh no. Not again.
          
          One look at his watch and he is off running. He throws some
          clothes and a toothbrush in a bag. His cell phone rings.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)
                    Hello?... What do you mean? I'm not
                    late. It's not even 10:30...
          
          Jackson turns off the TV and darts towards the door, stopping
          only to slide his laptop into a knapsack. As he turns, he
          stumbles over a stack of books, all shrink-wrapped and
          identically titled: `Farewell Atlantis'.
          
                                     JACKSON (CONT'D)

          Frustrated, he kicks them out of his way and exits. We hold
          on the books and realize that Jackson's photograph is on
          their back covers.

          The phone call continues as Jackson opens the garage door,
          struggling to pack his old SUV with camping equipment.
          
                                     JACKSON
                    They're kids, Kate, going on vacation.
                    It's not a doctor's appointment... it's
                    supposed to be fun. You remember that,
                    right? Fun?
          
          He tries to start the engine, but the battery is dead.
          Frustrated, he hits the steering wheel.
          
                                                                       11.

          Jackson runs across the street with his camping equipment,
          throwing it into the trunk of a stretch limo parked by the
          curb.
          
                                     JACKSON

                    Yellowstone, Kate. I'll pick some up on
                    the way.
          
          He notices a deep crack in the asphalt. His neighbors, an
          elderly couple, stand there and stare at it.
          
                                     NEIGHBOR

                    Wisconsin.

          Jackson passes a man in a wheelchair. He's holding up a
          cardboard sign: `Repent - The End is Near'.
          
          
          EXT. KATE'S HOUSE/LOS ANGELES - MORNING
          
          Jackson stops and honks in front of an upscale Westwood home.

          Jackson switches the radio off. Two kids NOAH, 10, and LILLY,
          7, come running down the driveway. They slow down, as they
          see the limo.

          He shuts the trunk and gets back behind the wheel. She looks

                    So what?
          
                                     HARRY
                    Well Tony, electronics are cheap there
                    and... you could visit your boy Will.

          TONY shoots a charmers smile at a couple of older single
          ladies on sun loungers. They smile back coyly.
          
                                     HARRY
                    Are you even listening to me?
          
                                     TONY
                    Yes unfortunately I am Harry.
          
                                     HARRY
                    I heard from Audrey you're a grandpa
                    now.
          
                                     TONY
                    Why don't you keep your nose out of my
                    family. You're cramping my style.
          
                                     HARRY
                    He married a Japanese girl - how is
                    that the end of the world? You should
                    at least go see him.

                                     TONY
                    Why? Do you see your boy?
          
                                     HARRY
                    Not as much as I'd like. DC is a long
                    way. But at least we talk.
          
                                       TONY
                    What about?

                    Life, how short it is...
          
          Suddenly they're thrown off balance by a large swell that
          pulls the massive `Freedom of the Seas' away from the
          landing, about ten yards.
          
          The next moment, the ship slams back against the dock with an
          earthshaking BOOM.

                    What the hell was that?
          
          A murmur goes through the crowd. Luckily nobody is injured.

          The phone rings twice before Laura switches on a light. We

          answers the phone.

          Picard is speeding in his Peugeot, anxiously checking his
          rear view mirror.

                    I had my suspicions. I should have said
                    something. They are following me.
          
                                       LAURA (O.S.)
                    Who is?

          Picard's car approaches a tunnel.

          The Peugeot enters a tunnel.

                    Then where is it?
          
          A huge blast rips through the tunnel as his car explodes.

          We hear the roar of a V8 engine, piped out through some

          An '89 Mustang bursts like a shot over a rise in the highway.
          It's got a rusted two-tone paint job, Maryland plates, and
          bald tires that scream as it peels off an exit and into the

          We don't see the DRIVER, only the redlining RPMs, Vans slip-

          cranks right as the car turns onto a -
                         
          One way street. A minivan flies right at us. The Mustang
          hops up onto the curb to avoid it, clips a trash can and -
                         
          Garbage explodes like confetti. The wipers engage, brushing
          the trash aside. The car whips another turn and

          The Driver jumps out of the car. As he rushes to the front
          door, we see the urgent package he is delivering.
                         
          TWO LARGE PIZZAS
                         
          Before he can ring the bell, the door opens and two smug 15-
          YEAR-OLDS stare out.
                         
                          15-YEAR-OLD
           That's 34 minutes. You're 4 minutes
           late. Pizza's free.

          Right now, he is tired and unamused, wearing a red ""Giorgio's

                          WILL
           Gimme a break. You guys live two
           towns away. It's pretty much fucking
           impossible to get here in 30 minutes.
                         
                          OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD
           Exactly. That's why we ordered from

           We'd rather take the pizzas.

           Ok. You guys are pretty smart. You

           Little pizza and a rainbow party?
                         
          The kids shakes their heads.
                         
                          WILL
           Seriously? Well, two hustlers like
           yourselves gotta have the place
           stocked with beer and whippits and
           shit, right? Just call the girls up
           and let them know the party's on.
                         
                          15-YEAR-OLD
           Man, we don't have any of that stuff.
                         
          Will makes a show of mulling this over.
                         
                          WILL
           I really shouldn't do this...but you
           seem like a couple of good dudes.
           I'll tell you what, you give me the
           money that your mom left you for the
           pizzas, and I'll grab you some beers.

          The kids look at each other. One hesitantly pulls out some

          A six pack of Budweiser rests in the passenger seat.
                         
          Will stops at a light. Checks out a PRETTY YOUNG THING in
          the Jeep beside him. She catches him looking, rolls her
          eyes. The light turns and the Jeep skids away.
                         
          Will self consciously removes his ""Giorgio's"" cap.

           Yo, Chris. Let me cash the fuck out.
                         
          Will hands over some cash to Christopher.

           For sure. I mean, the part where I
           had to drop off all those pizzas
           kinda sucked, but the rest was cool.

           Oh, yeah? 'Cause, I got some kids
           calling in saying you ripped them off.
           Promised to buy them beer or something.
                         
                          WILL
           I actually did buy the beer, but it
           would have been illegal to give it
           to them, right? So I'm gonna do the
           responsible thing and drink it myself.

           That's real funny. But I'm trying

                          WILL
           What kind of business promises to
           deliver anywhere in 30 minutes?
           It's ridiculous.

           I don't wanna hear another one of
           your bullshit excuses. You're fired.

                          CHRISTOPHER
           You know, you were an okay driver
           half the time. And you're not a Puerto
           Rican. Which means something to me.
                         
                          WILL
           That's poignant.
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           I guess I could rehire you, on a
           provisional basis. Of course, this
           would be at the slightly reduced
           ""new company rate.""
                         
                          WILL
           Are you fucking serious?
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           I don't know. Is there anyone else
           left in town for you to work for?
           5.
                         
          Will shakes his head. Swallows what's left of his pride.
                          WILL
           When do I start?
          EXT. SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
          Will sits on the darkened front stoop. He tosses an empty
          can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer.
          He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra. A YOUNG MAN sits
          in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face. He
          makes a sudden, surprised gasp. The homely YOUNG WOMAN who
          was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges
          herself in the driver seat. She leans over for a goodbye
          kiss. The Young Man obliges with much fanfare.
          The Young Man gets out and the car pulls away. This is CHET
          (25), a clean cut guy dressed in the Gap Premium Collection.
          He heads toward the building, high off his BJ, humming
          Outkast's ""Ms. Jackson."" He stops when he notices Will in
          the shadows.
                          CHET
           What the hell? Have you just been
           sitting there?
                          WILL
           Yep. Caught the whole show. Really
           classy move at the end. You know,
           the kiss. Putting your tongue in
           her mouth right after you fucked it.
                          CHET
           Hey, a nice girl decides to pleasure
           me on a weeknight, in her car no
           less...I'm not gonna make her feel
           like an untouchable. I'm gonna make
           her feel like a lady.
                          WILL
           What manners. May I offer you some
           alcohol, sir. To wash the taste of
           yourself out of your mouth.
          Will offers his beer. Chet takes a slug, gurgles for effect.
                         
                          CHET
           By the way, she said she had a friend.
           Maybe we can go on our first double
           date since you tried to talk Jackie
           Fortunato and her cousin into having
           a four-way with us.
                         
                          WILL
           I misread their body language. It
           happens.
           6.
                         
          Will picks up some rented movies sitting beside him.
                         
                          WILL
           Come on. Let's go inside, drink
           your beer and watch shit get crazy.
                          (FANS MOVIES)
           Old favorites. You choose. Lethal
           Weapon, Lethal Weapon 2...was gonna
           get the third Lethal Weapon, but
           decided on a porn. So it's really
           between the first two.
                         
                          CHET
           I choose sleep. I gotta teach a
           class at eight.
                         
                          WILL
           You're a sub. Just call in sick.
           Like the real teacher did.
                         
                          CHET
           Come on, man, you know I got promoted
           to full-time last month. You bought
           me a laser pointer.
                         
          Will heaves a sigh.
                         
                          WILL
           Yeah, I know. I guess I'm just having
           a hard time accepting you as ""the
           man."" You know, flunking kids, giving
           out spite detentions to girls you
           wanna fuck, laser pointing at shit.
                         
                          CHET
           I also get healthcare and my summers
           off. It's not perfect, but it's a
           career.
                         
          Will grudgingly stands up.
                         
                          WILL
           I guess that's just the difference
           between you and me.
                         
          He holds up the Lethal Weapon DVDs.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm like Riggs. Cruising the streets.
           No rules, no attachments. Every
           other day some asshole is trying to
           take my badge. You're fucking
           Murtaugh. Always worried about your
           pension. Well, guess what, it gets
           old after the first movie.
           7.
                         
                          CHET
           I just got head. I'm totally Riggs.
          Will shakes his head, turns and walks off.
          INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY
          Will wakes up, legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch.
          His TV is still on, displaying the menu screen from a porn.
          Will looks down at his coffee table. Clears some magazines
          to reveal a file folder. Flips the cover -
          It's full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays,
          a junior college transcript. Will thumbs through one of the
          glossy applications. The kids look young. Very young.
          Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and Chet at
          high school graduation, looking just as young. They have
          their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them. Will
          and the girl look very high and very happy.
          Will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee table
          debris. He looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00 PM.
                          WILL
           Fuck.
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY
          Will jumps in and starts the engine. As he tucks his
          ""Giorgio's"" cap onto his head, he catches his reflection in
          the rear-view mirror.
                         
                          WILL
           You asshole. You titanic asshole.
           Come on down and get your prize.
                         
          He makes his fingers into a gun, puts it to his head...pulls
          the trigger and
                         
          BOOM!
                         
                         WE'RE IN
                         
          EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY
                         
          A watermelon explodes in a shower of red, juicy bits. Loud,
          dumb laughter echoes.
                         
          Standing 20 yards away is DWAYNE (32), an intense, meaty guy
          in a sleeveless Baltimore Ravens t-shirt. On his left bicep
          is a tattoo of the Tasmanian Devil flipping the bird.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fruit motherfuckin' salad!
           8.
                         
          Crouched beside him is JAY (27), tall and awkward, in a wool
          surplus cap. He carefully rigs homemade explosives to another
          watermelon, then looks up at Dwayne. His eyes are magnified
          into saucers by his thick glasses. There's a peculiar
          eagerness to please in them.
                         
                          JAY
           This one's gonna blow even bigger.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Boy, if you weren't such a skinny
           little bitch you coulda been in the
           military or something.
                         
                          JAY
           Whatever. I don't need the military.
           I taught myself how to do this shit.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I hear that. I taught myself how to
           eat pussy. And cut my own hair.
                         
          Jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away. He returns
          and pulls out a detonator. Dwayne snatches it.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           This one's all me.
           (makes ""radio"" sounds)
           Mr. President, we have enemies at
           the gate. Give me the order.
           (more ""radio"" sounds)
           Fuck that, sir. I don't negotiate
           with terrorists!
                         
          Dwayne presses a button and
                         
          BOOM!
                         
          The explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys'
          smiling faces with fruit juice.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Large and early-90s chic. Dwayne and Jay have the fridge
          open, fixing themselves a cold cut plate. Dwayne is debating
          the amount of meat on the plate...adds some more.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Wanna make sure I get enough calories.
                         
                          JAY
           I thought you wanted to get diesel
           for the summer. Bang that towel
           girl at the community pool.
           9.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's obvious you don't know shit-all
           about physical fitness. You gotta
           bulk up first, then you slim down.
           I'm clearly in the bulk up phase. I
           told you to watch Pumping Iron like
           a month ago. If you'd listened to
           me, maybe you'd know what the fuck
           I'm talking about.
                          (BEAT)
           Grab some RC Cola.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The shades are drawn. We hear a girl scream bloody murder!
                         
          The guys are watching FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3...in 3D. They
          both wear cheap cardboard glasses.
                         
          Jay jumps back as Jason wields a 3D ax.
                         
                          JAY
           Shit, man! It's so real!
                         
          Dwayne reaches out, ""touching"" the 3D images. He stands and
          starts humping the air.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Check it out. I ain't afraid of
           Jason. I'm fucking him.
                          (THRUSTING HARDER)
           You like that, Jason!? In the mask!
                         
          Jay cracks up. The lights flick on.
                         
           GRIZZLED VOICE (O.S.)
           Who are you two fags fucking?
                         
          Standing by the switch is Dwayne's dad, JERRY (70s). Most
          people just call him ""THE MAJOR."" The faded USMC tattoo on
          his thick forearm explains why.
                         
                          JAY
           Afternoon, Major.
                         
          Dwayne flops back onto the couch.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Dad, we're watching a flick. We got
           45 minutes and a potential 3D sex
           scene left. You're sorta coming in
           at the worst possible moment.
           10.
                         
                          MAJOR
           I bought that TV set so I could watch
           my programs, not so you and your
           friend could louse up my couch.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You gotta learn how to share the
           common space.
                         
                          MAJOR
           The only thing common in this house
           is you. You remind me of your damn
           mother. Fat, dumb, and in my way.
                         
          The Major grabs Dwayne and pulls him up off the couch. He
          gets right in his face...scary, intense. Dwayne turns to Jay.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Let's get outta here. This movie
           sucks anyway.
                         
          Jay gets up and files out the door. Dwayne goes to take the
          cold cut plate. The Major grabs his arm.
                         
                          MAJOR
           I paid for the damn cold cuts, too.
           Maybe if you had a job, or a fucking
           prospect, or a clue how to find any
           of the above, I'd let you eat 'em.
                         
                          DWAYNE
                          (QUIETLY)
           You know, you can be a real
           sonofabitch, dad.
                         
                          MAJOR
           That's what it takes, boy. In the
           Corps, men like you wore dresses to
           keep us entertained.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That's pretty fucking disturbing!
                         
          Dwayne storms off.
                         
          EXT. NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Dwayne and Jay head out, passing a brand new pickup truck in
          the driveway. Dwayne spits on it.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fuck The Major!
                         
          The guys get in a shitty Ford Aerostar minivan and peel out.

          INT. DIVE STRIP CLUB - DAY
                         
          R. Kelly's ""Ignition (Remix)"" pumps.
                         
          Large, fake breasts, sparkling with cheap body glitter and
          pierced at the nipples, shake before us. Their owner, JUICY
          (27), a petite Latina, phones in a lap dance as Dwayne pours
          his heart out to her.
                         
          Somewhere in the background, Jay hangs at the bar, all alone.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           - and he thinks he knows me. He
           don't know shit. I got ideas he
           could never dream of. I got plans
           bigger than his fucking house.
                          (BEAT)
           He didn't even raise me. My mother
           did. That was a good woman.
                         
                          JUICY
           Oh yeah? What happened to her?
                         
          Dwayne shifts, uncomfortably, at the sore subject.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           She passed on.
                         
                          JUICY
           I hope you're not one of those guys
           that comes here looking to get
           mothered.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I wouldn't mind nursing on them
           titties, mamacita.
                         
                          JUICY
           Sure. Whatever you say. Maybe just
           keep quiet for a while, forget about
           your old man and let me do my thing.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I wish I could forget about that
           asshole for good. I'm just waiting
           around for him to drop dead. Don't
           wanna mess with my inheritance.
                         
          This piques Juicy's interest.
                         
                          JUICY
           What kinda inheritance?
           12.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           When my dad got outta the service, he
           started buying lotto tickets. He'd
           play his dog tag numbers. In '91,
           the fucker won five million bucks.
          INSERT PHOTO: The Major holding a giant cardboard check.
                          DWAYNE
           He had some health problems a few
           years back, and since then he's been
           burning through the money like an
           NBA draft pick. Probably only got a
           million or two left. But it's mine
           as soon as he kicks.
          Behind inch-long fake eyelashes, Juicy's shrewd eyes narrow,
          mind working. She straddles Dwayne, tightly.
                          JUICY
           You know, with a million bucks, you
           could have anything. Be like a king.
           (almost a moan)
           King Dwayne.
                          DWAYNE
           That's right. And maybe I'll make
           you my queen. Let you polish my
           royal scepter.
                          JUICY
           Practice makes perfect.
          Juicy pantomimes a long, slow chicken head. Dwayne is blissed
          out. She smiles at him, sticky sweet.
                          JUICY
           Let me ask you a question...do you
           really hate your daddy?
                          DWAYNE
           Hate him like the Steelers.
                          JUICY
           Then maybe I can help you get that
           money now. Before he spends another
           penny.
                         
          Dwayne looks confused. Juicy puts his hands on her breasts,
          emboldening him.
                         
                          JUICY
           I know a guy in Baltimore. He could
           help you out. Probably do it for...
           (sizing him up)
           ...100Gs.
           13.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Do what?
                         
          Juicy leans in, whispers softly in Dwayne's ear -
                         
                          JUICY
           Kill your mean old dad.
                         
          On Dwayne's face as this new possibility pinballs around his
          mind, setting off a flood of different emotions.
                         
                          JUICY
           So, what do you think...you ready
           for your crown?

          Rows of cubicles. Speckled with late night STRAGGLERS, bleary
          eyes, too busy generating detailed lists of places they'd
          rather be to notice the pizza boy walking along. Will stops
          before one such work station, looks on for a beat.
                         
                          WILL

          KATE (25) turns from the glow of her computer screen. She
          has short, messy hair and a sarcastic smile. This is the
          girl from the picture in Will's apartment.
                         
                          KATE
           That's the plan. Five days, six
           nights. Culture. Beaches.
           Acceptable probability of kidnapping.
           I leave in the morning.
                         
          Kate looks back at her computer, logged onto an Expedia
          checkout page for a Rio vacation. She moves the mouse pointer
          from the ""proceed"" key...closes the window.
                         
                          KATE

           Fuck Expedia. Travel Advisor. Making
           it seem so easy.

           while.
                         
                          KATE
           Even if I could afford that...they
           fired two other paralegals last week.
           Now's not the time to be putting in
           for vacation days.
                         
                          WILL
           Ok. Done. I've got my dose of the
           actual working world. Can we eat?
                         
          Will lays a pizza down on her desk.
                         
                          KATE

           He's there like half the time. The
           other half I smile at him. I'm
           relatively certain he's a homosexual.
                         
                          KATE
           Interesting theory...
                         
          Kate opens the pizza box, grabs a slice.
                         
                          KATE
           Maybe I should set him up with Tom
           Small. He came out to me today on
           Facebook.
                         
                          WILL

           Chet in grammar school. Wow.
                         
                          KATE
           Tell me about it. He fingered me at
           junior prom while they were playing
           ""No Scrubs.""

           Really? What a fucking scrub.
                         
          Will grabs a slice. They eat quietly for a beat.

           I thought the Tom Small stuff was
           enough of a headline, but go ahead.
                         
                          KATE

          his best to swallow it down.
                         
                          WILL
           But you...you broke up with
           him...ended the relationship.
           Finality was had.
                         
                          KATE

                          WILL
           Forget it. I don't want to know.
                         
                          KATE
           You sound like Chet.
                         
                          WILL
           Woah, don't compare me to your
           brother.
                         
                          KATE
           Well, neither one of you seems to
           care that I don't have a life. Mark's
           not perfect...but a relationship is
           better than working late every Friday
           because I have nowhere else to be.
                         
                          WILL
           Sure. I get it. Here we are. Friday
           night. Nowhere to be.
                         
          Kate shoves Will, good-naturedly.
                         
                          KATE
           You know what I mean.
                         
          Will shrugs, quietly devastated. Goes back to his pizza.

              OPEN COUNTRY - DAY

              Endless green hills bisected by a ribbon of highway. A road
              gang clearing brush by the side of the road... Twenty-five
              men in prison fatigues sweating through their mid-afternoon
              labor.

              THREE GUARDS

              Flank the working prisoners... Mountie hats, shotguns,
              sidearms, sunglasses; they look like they mean it.

              HIGHWAY

              A battered pickup appears...approaches. Suddenly, it coughs,
              shudders, stalls. A big Blackfoot Indian named BILLY BEAR
              gets out and starts cursing and kicking the vehicle.Then he
              begins walking toward the road gang...

              ROADSIDE

              BRADY is the Guard near the center of the work gang; he
              smiles at the oncoming man, pokes a prisoner beside him.

                                  BRADY
                        Wonder what reservation they let
                        him off of...

              The prisoner is GANZ who looks up, grins at Brady...

                                  GANZ
                        Yeah, there goes the neighborhood.

              Brady laughs as Billy Bear closes in on him.

                                  BILLY
                        Say, buddy, my engine's
                        overheating and I got 30 miles
                        before the next station... Could
                        I get some water out of your
                        cooler?

              Ganz leans on his hoe, speaks as Billy passes...

                                  GANZ
                        Maybe you shoulda stole a better
                        truck, Tonto.

                                  BILLY
                        You got a real big mouth, convict.

                                  BRADY
                        It's okay, chief.  He's just
                        joking...

                                  BILLY
                        How about the water...






                                  GANZ
                        Firewater, Tonto?  Is that what
                        you...

              Billy whirls, swings at Ganz. Both men roll to the ground.

                                  BRADY
                        Hey! Jesus Christ!

              THE OTHER GUARDS

              Seeing the commotion, they run toward it.

              GANZ AND BILLY

              As they struggle, Billy slips a pistol into Ganz' hand.

                                  BRADY
                        That's a state prisoner,
                        asshole...! Back off...

              ROADSIDE

              Brady pulls Billy away from Ganz just 'as one of the other
              officers arrives... Ganz suddenly whips out a pistol, shoots
              Brady at point-blank range. Before the other Guards can even
              react, Billy comes out with his own pistol, caps the Second
              Guard.

              THIRD GUARD

              Still forty yards away... In mid-draw, be howls as a bullet
              from Ganz breaks the nearby ground. He fires, then turns and
              runs for the prison bus.

              GANZ

              Smiling, fires twice. but the range is too great for pistol
              work...

              THE OTHER PRISONERS

              Watching....Then they all scatter in different directions...

              GANZ

              Hefts his weapon...

                                  GANZ
                        Come on...

              He and the big Indian run to the pickup, climb in and roar
              away.

              INT. BUS

              The THIRD GUARD making a call on the police radio...

                                  OFFICER
                        Escape in progress. Two officers
                        shot off rail crossing 31.
                        Prisoners escaping. Two men, one
                        six-four, 200 pounds, dark, an
                        Indian, the other, Albert Ganz,
                        five-ten...

              FURTHER DOWN THE HIGHWAY

              Several miles from the escape... A big semi parked by the
              side of ttie road; back doors to the closed trailer open. A
              station wagon parked across the road. The pickup appears,
              approaches the semi, slows down and drives up the ramp into
              the van. Ganz and Billy jump out, shove the ramp up inside
              the truck and close the big doors.

              STATION WAGON

              Ganz and Billy climb inside ancl roar off, back in the
              direction of the road gang.

              BILLY BEAR

              Takes off his hat, puts on a baseball cap and sunglasses...

                                  BILLY
                        Get ready to duck.

              Ganz dives for the floor. Three police cars go by, sirens
              blaring, lights flashing. They pass the road gang. Ganz
              reappear, smiles...

                                  GANZ
                        You know something? I'm having a
                        real good time.

              HIGHWAY

              The station wagon blasts down the pavement... Becomes a small
              dot on the landscape.

              TRANSITION.

              A DOORWAY - NIGHT

              the portal slams open revealing a man holding a huge
              pistol,jack cates, s.F.P.D., a large and powerful man... He
              stealthily moves up a stairwell.






              CORRIDOR

              He stops at the top of the stairs... Listens gun still ready.
              A continuous sound of running water... Cates moves toward the
              bathroom. Rips the door open.

              BATHROOM

              The shape behind the shower curtain freezes. Cates, gun held
              level, moves forward... Rips the shower curtain open.
              Revealing a young and very beautiful woman, ELAINE MARSHALL.

                                  CATES
                        Inspector Jack Cates, S.F.P.D....
                        And you're wanted.

              Elaine stares at him as Cates turns off the water.

                                  ELAINE
                        What am I wanted for?

                                  CATES
                        I don't answer questions, I ask
                        'em...

              A moment as she continues to stare at his pistol.

                                  ELAINE
                        I don't think your gun's loaded...

                                  CATES
                        This is a .44 Magnum, the most
                        powerful handgun in the world. You
                        gotta ask yourself just one
                        question. Are you feelin' lucky?

                                  ELAINE
                        I still don't think it's loaded.

              Elaine shakes her head and smiles, folds her arms over her
              breasts, shivers a little... Cates looks at the cylinder,
              spins it...

                                  CATES
                        Hey, you're right.

                                  ELAINE
                        You're hopeless.

                                  CATES
                        That's the way I see it, too.

              Be puts the gun down on the edge of the sink, embraces her.

                                  ELAINE
                        I'm all wet.






                                  CATES
                        What's wrong with that?

              They both smile.

              TRANSITION.

              BEDROOM

              Cates in bed with Elaine.  She wears his shirt.

                                  ELAINE
                        A guy in the bar called me a dumb
                        bitch today.

                                  CATES
                        What'd you do?

                                  ELAINE
                        Irrigated his face with the shot
                        of J and B I'd just poured him.
                        Then I tried to deck the sucker.

                                  CATES
                        I guess he got the message...

                                  ELAINE
                        Then I sit back and I think, I
                        mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb
                        bitch.  I work in a bar, right?
                        I can't read a list of my academic
                        credentials to every booze-hound
                        that comes in the place... You are
                        what you do...

                                  CATES
                        Positive self-image problem all
                        over again ... You are who you
                        decide you are unless you're the
                        type that lets assholes decide for
                        you.

                                  ELAINE
                        Aren't you the one that thinks all
                        psychotherapy is bullshit?

                                  CATES
                        I do think all psychotherapy is
                        bullshit. But just because I think
                        it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't
                        know something about it.

                                  ELAINE
                        If this is your idea of
                        sympathetic interest in my
                        problems, I'll take brutal
                        indifference.





                                  CATES
                        Hey, you know what I really think?

                                  ELAINE
                        Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.

                                  CATES
                        I think you're ashamed to tend bar
                        which is sad because you look
                        great in that outfit they make you
                        wear... You pull down four bills
                        a week which is damn good, and you
                        mix the best Pina Coladas I've
                        ever had... I think that if you
                        need bigger and better things ...
                        then go for em.

              She smiles at him after this. It looks like they'll kiss.
              Their faces are close.  Then she lightly moves back.

                                  ELAINE
                        You oversimplify every...

              He stops her in the middle of the sentence by kissing her,
              then pulls back...

                                  CATES
                        Some things are simple, right?

              Their faces are very close ... but they don't touch for
              another second.

                                  ELAINE
                        Right...

              TRANSITION.

              SAN FRANCISCO - DAWN

              Titles continue.

              Tugs churning across the bay... Quiet city streets. Parked
              cars covered with early morning dew... A newspaper truck
              slowly grinds by, drops a bundleand moves on.

              EMBARCADERO - DAWN

              The station wagon pulls up to a young punk, HENRY WONG, on a
              motorcycle.

              Billy Bear smiles and leans out the driver's side window.

                                  BILLY
                        You got somethin' for us, Henry?

              Henry produces some credit cards.  Billy passes them to Ganz
              for inspection.





                                  GANZ
                        How hot are they?

                                  HENRY
                        Hot?  Hey, they're not even room
                        temperature.

              Ganz snorts derisively.

                                  GANZ
                        How ya doin'?

                                  HENRY
                        Can't complain.

                                  GANZ
                        We got a lot to talk about.

                                  HENRY
                        Yeah, old times.

                                  GANZ
                        We'll follow you.  Take it
                        slow,okay?

                                  HENRY
                        Sure, right.

              Ganz pockets the credit cards as Henry wheels away.

              INT.  STATION WAGON

                                  GANZ
                        I want to drive awhile.

                                  BILLY
                        I ain't tired yet.

              INT.  STATION WAGON

                                  GANZ
                        Maybe after we get done with him
                        I'm gonna buy us some girls.

                                  BILLY
                        Whaddya mean, buy?

                                  GANZ
                        Pros.

              Ganz stares at Billy.

                                  BILLY
                        Pay money?

                                  GANZ
                        Yeah, dummy.  Money.





                                  BILLY
                        I never paid for it in my life.

                                  GANZ
                        It's better when you pay... they
                        let you do anything.

                                  BILLY
                        They always let me do anything. I
                        don't want to pay for it.  I never
                        paid for it in my life.

                                  GANZ
                        Just do what I say, okay? We'll
                        pay for the girls and have a good
                        time... Don't you trust me?

              Billy smiles.

                                  BILLY
                        Sure, I trust ya.

              They drive off.

              NORTH BEACH - RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAWN

              First light breaks over Telegraph Hill. A quiet row of
              Victorian townhouses now converted into apartments.

              APARTMENT BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

              Cates is sprawled across the double bed; Elaine is on the
              verge of falling off the edge. Cates' eyes snap open.  A
              second later, his wrist watch alarm goes off.  He turns it
              off, gets out of bed and begins pulling on his pants. Elaine
              sits up in bed, still wearing Cates' blue shirt... Cates
              picks up a robe as Elaine gets out of bed on the opposite
              side, throws the robe to Elaine... She takes off the shirt,
              swaps it for the robe and throws the shirt to Jack.

                                  ELAINE
                        You know, if you let me come over
                        to your place once in a while, you
                        could put on a clean shirt in the
                        morning.

                                  CATES
                        What makes you think I have any
                        clean shirts at my place?

              He buttons his shirt and heads for the kitchen.

              KITCHEN

              Cates brushing his teeth at the sink, Elaine making coffee.







                                  ELAINE
                        You know, that's my toothbrush,
                        Jack.

              He keeps brushing.

                                  CATES
                        Maybe you ought to buy me one.

                                  ELAINE
                        Maybe I would if I knew when you
                        were coming back.

              He stops brushing, turns and looks at her.

                        I'm here.  And I've been coming
                        back for quite awhile... Let's not
                        hassle, okay?  And can I have a
                        cup of coffee?  Please.

              She pours some coffee, hands him a cup and saucer... Cates
              pours some whiskey into it from a flask.

                                  ELAINE
                        That's a fairly crummy way to
                        start a morning.

                                  CATES
                        Maybe I got a fairly crummy day
                        ahead.

                                  ELAINE
                        Maybe that makes a nice excuse.

                        Maybe you don't know what the hell
                        you're talking about.

              Cates picks his holstered .44 off a chair back and begins
              strapping it on.

                                  ELAINE
                        When you start with that
                        attitude... it's like I don't know
                        who you are.

                        What do you want to know?  What
                        difference does it make?  I'm the
                        guy in your bed the last three
                        months.  I make you feel good. You
                        make me feel good.  What the hell
                        else do you want from a guy?








                                  ELAINE
                        I wish you'd stop trying to make
                        me mad so I won't care for you...
                        I wish you'd give me a little more
                        of a chance.

              He turns away, moves into the corridor near the stairwell.

                                  CATES
                        I don't have time for this. I
                        gotta go to work.

              She stands frozen... He turns back and looks at her; it's
              hard to apologize.

                        I figure anything might be
                        possible.

              She is warmed up by the first part, amused by the second; she
              approaches...

                        You sure you want me to?

                        Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...

              He moves closer, kisses her..

                                  CATES
                        Thanks for the coffee.

                        Jack, wait.  Here...

              She puts a scarf around his neck.

                        ever spent was the summer I spent
                        in San Francisco...

              They don't kiss.  He nods appreciately, the scarf in hand as
              he turns and goes.

              STREET - NORTH BEACH - MORNING

              Cates comes out of Elaine's apartment building, crosses to
              his whipped and battered  64 Cadillac convertible, notices a

              puts the scarf around the rear view mirror, starts the engine

              CITY STREET

              Cates driving the convertible; he comes down a hill and turns

              STREET - BROADWAY DISTRICT - DAY

              LUTHER and ROSALIE, a young couple, turn a corner.  A dark
              parody of all-American young marrieds.  They are bickering as
              usual.

                                  ROSALIE
                        I liked that carpet we saw.







                                  LUTHER
                        We can't afford it.

                                  ROSALIE
                        Don't remind me.

                        Whaddya want me to do, go out and
                        steal for the money?  I hated the
                        color anyway; the color sucked...

              Suddenly, Billy and Ganz descend on Luther and Rosalie and
              pull them into their station wagon..

              INT.  STATION WAGON

              Billy has Rosalie by the mouth, gagging her with his big
              paw... Ganz has his gun at Luther's neck.

                                  GANZ
                        Surprise, Luther.

                                  LUTHER
                        Whaddya want?  I thought you were
                        locked up-

                                  GANZ
                        I want the money, asshole, what do
                        you think?  The money that Reggie
                        hid...

                                  LUTHER
                        I don't know what you're talkin'
                        about.

                                  GANZ
                        You want that Indian to snap her
                        neck?

              He mimes the gesture... snap...

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Instead of worryin' about Reggie,
                        you better worry about me...

                                  LUTHER
                        Don't give me this, we were
                        partners.

                                  GANZ
                        Billy, go ahead, break it...

                                  LUTHER
                        No! Don't kill her.  I can get you
                        the money.






                                  GANZ
                        When?

                                  LUTHER
                        I can't get it until Monday.
                        Honest.

                                  GANZ
                        You chickenshit punk...

                                  LUTHER
                        Honest. The place we stashed it
                        opens Monday morning. I can't get
                        it till then. Monday morning,
                        that's when it opens. After that,
                        I'll get the money to you right
                        away...

              Ganz finally takes the gun from the neck.

                                  GANZ
                        I always liked you, Luther. You
                        were always a lotta fun to hang
                        out with...

              Rosalie is rubbing her neck now that she's been released...
              Ganz gestures to Billy.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        We're gonna keep her.

              Luther desperately doesn't like this.

                                  LUTHER
                        Come on, you can trust me. Please.

                                  GANZ
                        You try to mess with us or go to
                        the cops, I promise you, I'll put
                        holes in her you wouldn't believe.

              He smiles at Luther, pinches him on the cheek, shoves him out
              of the car.

              LUTHER

              Stands shivering as it powers away.

              WALDEN HOTEL - DAY

              A small hotel on one of the quiet streets behind Union Square.

              A GREEN COUGAR

              Rosalie is very nervous.

                                  ROSALIE
                        What are you gonna do to me in
                        there?

              Ganz gives her a casual smile.

                                  GANZ
                        Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut
                        your throat.

              They move out of the car, head for the hotel.

              LOBBY

              A FRIZZY YOUNG BLONDE sits behind the desk in a mirrored
              entrance hall.  She reads a lurid paperback. Morning traffic
              streams by outside as Ganz, Billy and Rosalie enter and
              approach the desk.

                                  GANZ
                        We need some rooms for a couple of

              She smiles at Ganz.

                        Sure.  We don't get many real

                        only stay an hour or two...

              Passes a form across. Ganz signs it, Frizzy glances at his
              signature then takes a key from the rack behind.

                                  GANZ
                        I want her young.  And tall. Nice

              BILLY BEAR

              Sees a couple approaching, he shoves the dead man down on the
              bench and spreads the newspaper over his head.  The body now
              looking like a typical park bum who has spent the night.
              Billy walks over to Ganz.

                                  BILLY
                        Hey, what about me?

                        And I need one more for my pal.
                        Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not
                        a turban, you know, a squaw.

              Billy smiles, takes the Polaroid...

              POLAROID

              A close shot of the dead man with the bullet hole in his
              forehead.

                        Put them next door, okay.

              She gives him a slightly knowing look.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Sure, hey, you got the whole floor
                        to yourself...

              Ganz sends her back a sharp look.

                        Keep your filthy ideas to
                        yourself, lady.

              Ganz picks up his suitcase, walks over to the nearest
              stairwell.  Billy and Rosalie follow...

              TRANSITION.

              STREET

              Bars starting to fill up with mid-day customers... A black
              Chevy cruises past and stops further up the block. Two
              Plainclothesmen, VANZANT and ALGREN, get out of the car. As
              they start toward the Walden...

              THE CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE

              Pulls up near the two men. Cates climbs out of his car and
              walks over to them.

                                  CATES
                        Hey, fellas, what's happening?
                        Radio said you guys had something
                        on...

                                  ALGREN
                        Not much, Jack ... Salesman named
                        Polson had his credit cards
                        lifted...

              Algren nods over to the parking lot opposite.

                                  ALGREN
                               (continuing)
                        One of Polson's cards rented that
                        green coupe.

                                  VANZANT
                        Not too much for a big rough tough
                        gunfighter like you to do on this
                        one...

              Cates smiles at the verbal positioning he's used to with his
              colleagues.

                                  CATES

                                  ALGREN
                        Five and dime stuff. Polson said
                        a kid with a switchblade mugged
                        him and drove off on a motorcyle.








                                  CATES
                        Yeah, well, I guess you two are
                        experts at taking boy scout knives
                        away from teenagers...

                                  VANZANT
                        Yeah, we are, that means you can
                        stay outta this one. We don't have
                        any big need for the artillery

              Vanzant's turn to smile.

                                  CATES
                        Hey, I'm just offering to help
                        out... I like to watch real pros
                        work.

                                  VANZANT
                        Help, huh?  Sometimes your kind of
                        help tends to leave the suspect in
                        bad shape.

              Algren...mediator... soothes the competitive situation.

                                  ALGREN
                        Hey, relax ... Jack, you wanna
                        come inside, fine... You can stake
                        out the lobby...

              Cates, a bit disgusted at the politics of this moment, nods...

          JANUARY 31, 1981
          Over black we hear the opening of a garage door. The light
          spills in and we see.
                         
                         
          EXT. UPPER MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, QUEENS NYC -
                         SUNRISE
                         
          Open on ABEL MORALES. It is early morning and still almost
          dark out. He has a rugged yet prosperously-handsome face and
          is in his mid-thirties. He is struggling to get started with
          his morning jog.
                         
                         
          EXT. SHIP GRAVEYARD, STATEN ISLAND NYC - DAY
                         
          It is early morning. A large bulk fuel oil transport truck
          sits idling next to a decrepit old dock. The dock sticks into
          a backwater section of New York harbor that is filled with
          the decaying remains of half-sunken abandoned barges and tug
          boats.
                         
          JULIAN, the young driver of the truck sits and nervously
          scans the horizon. Eventually a large fuel barge appears in
          the distance being pushed by a tug boat. The barge is steered
          past the skeletons of the other sunken ships and makes its
          way to the dock in front of the tanker truck.
                         
          JULIAN gets out of his truck and readies a large connecting
          hose. He looks around nervously. JULIAN steps across the
          broken boards of the dock and struggles to get the hose to
          the barge. He hands it to the BARGE OPERATOR with a nod of
          the head and no words.
                         
          They connect the hose and start a large generator as it
          begins to pump fuel into the truck. They both scan the
          horizon again as the sun begins to come up.
                         
                         
          EXT. MORE INDUSTRIAL QUEENS NEIGHBORHOOD- SAME TIME
                         
          ABEL is still jogging as the light begins to increase. It is
          freezing out. He is a very serious guy. He is not happy that
          he is out of shape. Finally he stops and bends over to catch
          his breath. We have run with him from the nicer part of the
          neighborhood to a rougher section. As he catches his breath
          he stands up and looks around. He is unsure of his feelings.

          INT. ANNA'S DRESSING AREA
          The camera slowly moves in as ANNA sits in a slip at her make
          up table putting on her face for the day ahead. She looks
          into the mirror as if she is putting on a coat of armor.
                         
                         
          INT. DRIVER'S CAB OF A BULK OIL TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY
                         
          STANDARD HEATING OIL, ""We set the Standard"" is written in
          logo form on the side of the tank.
                         
          The truck idles in traffic waiting to pay the toll to cross
          the Verrazano bridge that spans the mouth of New York harbor.
                         
          JULIAN, the young driver from the dock, cautiously looks
          around as the traffic inches along. He finally approaches the
          toll booth and pays.
                         
                          JULIAN
           Good morning.
                         
          JULIAN speaks English with a well-sanded accent. Is it
          Central American or Mexican? The female collector gives him a
          smile.
          He heads through the booth, but there is still traffic on the
          other side as the lanes merge together. Just as the traffic
          is about to pick up he looks in his rearview mirror and we
          see TWO GUYS come walking through the traffic and towards the
          cab. Before we know it they are climbing up the cab steps.
                         
          The GUY on the driver's side, LOUIS SERVIDIO, is small and
          very slight but he moves with great speed and strength. He
          shatters the glass side window with his elbow. Unlocks the
          door just as his partner, THUG #2, does the same thing on the
          passenger side, but he is holding a gun. They are not wearing
          masks. It's very brazen.
                         
          Before THUG #2 even asks JULIAN to get out of the cab LOUIS
          SERVIDIO crushes him in the jaw with three swift punches then
          pulls him out of the cab and down onto the roadway.
                         
          LOUIS SERVIDIO pulls the door shut and they drive away with
          the truck leaving JULIAN sitting in the middle of the road
          staring, as blood starts to flow from his jaw.
                         
                         
          INT. PARKING YARD OF STANDARD HEATING OIL- SAME TIME
                         
          Two almost-matching late model Mercedes pull up to a chain-
          link gate with a small sign that says ""STANDARD HEATING OIL:
          WE SET THE STANDARD"". The DISPATCHER opens the gate.
                          4
                         
                         
          They both pull into reserved parking spaces next to each
          other. ABEL is dressed in a very tasteful custom made suit.
          ABEL's wife ANNA was driving the car behind him. She is a
          beautiful, tall, blonde woman dressed to the nines but with a
          streak in her eye that this is all business. You would not
          want to cross this woman.
                         
                          ABEL
           Ready?
                          ANNA
           Yes.
                         
                          ABEL
           You look very nice.
                         
                          ANNA
           Thank you.
                         
                          ABEL
           You sure?
                         
                          ANNA
           Yes.
                         
          ABEL walks around and opens his trunk. He takes out two large
          empty briefcases.
                         
          He carries the briefcases as they both walk over to a large,
          unmarked, armored van that is idling in the middle of the
          parking lot. Two ARMED GUARDS get out of the van. One is
          holding a clipboard. He walks up to ANNA and ABEL. He hands
          them the clipboard. They look at each other one last time and
          then both sign the document.
                         
          The other GUARD opens up the back of the truck. ABEL hands
          him the briefcases and the guard begins to fill them with
          cash. Lots of cash. ABEL and ANNA stand at the open back of
          the van and just watch. Finally he finishes and hands the now-
          heavy cases to ABEL.
                         
          ABEL picks up the two cases and walks a bit away from the
          truck. He turns to ANNA.
                         
                          ANNA (CONT'D)
           Don't do anything stupid.
                         
                          ABEL
           We don't have any more money so
           what else could I do.
                         
          She gives a small smile. He looks at his watch. They kiss.
                          5
                         
                         
          ABEL turns and begins walking with the cases. He gives a nod
          to the DISPATCHER, who we now see, is in a small gatehouse,
          and he begins to open the front gate.
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE FRONT GATE- SAME TIME
                         
          ABEL walks out through the gate and down the abandoned
          industrial street about 25 yards, then looks to his right. He
          looks down at the cases in his hands, turns, and stands
          looking into the neighboring site.
                         
                         
          EXT. MASSIVE OIL TANK FARM: BROOKLYN NY WATERFRONT - DAY
                         
          ABEL comes walking across the parking lot and sees ANDREW
          WALSH standing in the middle of the dusty parking lot. ANDREW
          is their longtime LAWYER/RIGHT-HAND MAN and is in his mid
          fifties. He is smart but tired. The oversized briefcase in
          his left hand seems to have permanently tilted his posture
          that direction. The large oil-holding tanks loom above them.
          The place is rusting and could use some work.
                         
          As they wait, the setting has the look and choreography of an
          illegal transaction about to go down.
                          ANDREW WALSH
           So how are we this morning?
                         
                          ABEL
           (gives a smile and nod)
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           Well I woke up feeling very good
           about this.
                         
                          ABEL
           Really?
                         
          They both take a look at their watches.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           You've been telling me not to do
           this for a year.
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           Well we are going all in... so now
           I love it.
                         
          Gives him another slight smile. They stand around in awkward
          silence. Finally a late-model Ford Ltd. station wagon pulls
          into the lot.
                          6
                         
                         
           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
           Here we go.
          And a group of FIVE HASIDIC JEWS gets out. There are two guys
          in their twenties, two in their fifties, and one in his mid-
          to-late seventies. They all shake each other's hands then
          stand around for a beat.
                         
           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
           Should we head inside?
                         
          INT. SMALL TEMPORARY OFFICE TRAILER - DAY
                         
          The group is now jammed around a folding table inside the
          trailer. ABEL and his lawyer sit at one end facing the rest
          of them. Finally, the senior member of the group, JOSEPH
          MENDELSOHN, eyes up ABEL and leans forward. His accent is
          strong yet you can understand every word.
                         
                          JOSEPH
           So why is it you want this land?
                         
                          ABEL
           I'm sorry?
                          JOSEPH
           It has been difficult for you to
           get me here, no? Over a year?
                         
                          ABEL
           Almost two.
                         
                          JOSEPH
           There are many like it around? And
           thanks to all these tests you paid
           for, we now know it is as much of a
           mess below the ground as it is
           above. My people have looked at
           your books, I know this is a lot of
           money for you, so why have you kept
           on us so... just for this ugly and
           polluted little piece of the earth.
                         
                          ABEL
           I have been looking over my fence
           at this property for a very long
           time.
                         
                          JOSEPH
           So it is just proximity?
                          7
                         
                         
                          ABEL
           No... I imagine I want it for the
           same reason you did.
                         
                          JOSEPH
           And what's that?
                         
                          ABEL
           To grow.
                          JOSEPH
           Well, I am in the garment business
           so I appreciate that sentiment. But
           I inherited this land from my
           uncle. Sadly he had no children of
           his own. He was the one that let
           them build these tanks here. So
           this place can do little for me...
           in fact thanks to all those tests
           you've done it may be a liability.
           As you know I offered to lease the
           site to you at a fair price, but
           you were not interested?
                         
                          ABEL
           No.
                          JOSEPH
           Why not?
                         
                          ABEL
           I like to own the things I use.
                         
                          JOSEPH
           I can see that.
                         
          Long pause.
                         
                          ABEL
           So.
                         
                          JOSEPH
           Yes. This contract here, your
           lawyers have fully reviewed it?
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           Of course.
                         
                          JOSEPH
           And you have brought the money?
           (ABEL nodes yes)
           So you realize you have only thirty
           days to close this transaction?

                          JOSEPH (CONT'D)
           No extensions, no... contingencies
           whatsoever.
                          ABEL
           I understand.
                         
                          JOSEPH
           I want you to know this up front. I
           am a very fair man but I believe in
           honoring contracts. You will
           fulfill your end of this contract
           and the property is yours. If you
           can't we will keep your money and
           will sell it to your competitor who
           has been chasing us almost as badly
           as you have. I like you, but know
           that the only reason I am choosing
           you is because of the favorable
           terms of this contract. So this is
           business... and when you sign
           this....
                         
                          ABEL
           I understand.
                         
                          JOSEPH
           Well then, let's see this money,
           and then I will sign these papers.
                         
          ABEL turns to ANDREW and gives a slight nod. ANDREW pulls the
          black briefcase onto the table and opens it. It has seven
          hundred thousand dollars in cash in it. He slides it over to
          their side. The old man signs the contract and they shake
          hands.
                         
                         
          EXT. MASSIVE OIL TANK FARM PARKING LOT - DAY
                         
          ABEL stands next to ANDREW's car.
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           Congratulations.
                         
                          ABEL
           It's not ours yet.
                         
                          ANDREW WALSH
           Well, it was a hell of a job just
           getting them to this point. It's a
           good day for us. Take a walk
           around. Enjoy it for a second.
                         
          ANDREW gets in his car and drives away. ABEL looks around and
          decides to go for a little walk.
                          9
                         
                         
          He heads out towards the tanks and walks among them. They
          tower seven stories above him. As he walks, he is cut off
          like a maze from any other visual input. (Similar to being
          inside a Richard Serra sculpture) Finally he emerges into
          some light and as ABEL looks up the camera reveals his view.
          It's midtown Manhattan in all its glory, just across the East
          River from the site. He stares at the city and we see the
          true depths of his ambition lock on his face. He looks to his
          watch.
                         
          INT. 1981 MERCEDES 500 SEC
                         
          ABEL drives away from New York City. We see it behind his
          head.
                         
                         
          INT. CAR ON MERRITT PARKWAY
                         
          The terrain turns to upscale country.
                         
                         
          EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY
                         
          ABEL's car drives into a long driveway through the woods.
          Then an architect-designed, 80's modern house, still under
          construction, appears. He pulls up in front.
                         
          He gets out of the car and stands there looking at the large
          house. He walks into the house and we see more clearly that
          it is nearing completion. It is empty.
                         
                         
          INT. 80'S MODERN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          ABEL walks over to the massive floor-to-ceiling windows and
          stands looking over the large pond that sits down the hill
          from the house. As he stares out his CONTRACTOR comes quietly
          walking in behind him.
                         
                          CONTRACTOR
           Hello?
                         
                          ABEL
           There he is.
                         
          He walks up behind him and they both look out in silence for
          a beat.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           You have done a beautiful job here.
                         
                          CONTRACTOR
           Thank you.
                          10
                         
                         
                          ABEL
           I mean it. You and your men should
           be very proud.
                         
                          CONTRACTOR
           We are.
                         
                          ABEL
           Most people don't have anything
           beautiful like this to show for
           their day's work. You are a lucky
           man.
                         
                          CONTRACTOR
           I am.
                         
                          ABEL
           Well I thank you... my family will
           be very happy here.
                         
                          CONTRACTOR
           I hope so.
                         
                          ABEL
           Now I think I owe you some money.
                          CONTRACTOR
           That may be true.
                         
                          ABEL
           It is.
                         
          ABEL reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out a thick
          envelope of cash. As he does we see a transformation of his
          personality from pleasant philosopher to a direct voice of
          unquestioned authority.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           This is the seventeen outstanding.
           But we are arriving here in four
           days. It must be done.
                         
                          CONTRACTOR
           Yes.
                         
                          ABEL
           Well, I'll let you go.
                         
          He says this as he leads him to the door.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           And the tile in the master bath...

                          CONTRACTOR
           It's being replaced, as I mentioned
           to your wife, that was an error on
           our part. Congratulations on your
           home.
                         
                          ABEL
           Thank you.
                         
          EXT. TOP OF HILL ON OTHER SIDE OF POND LOOKING BACK AT HIS
          HOUSE. - DAY
                         
          ABEL stands, surrounded by massive trees in the thick forest,
          looking across the ridge back at his house. He is a little
          out of breath after climbing the hill but he looks strangely
          comfortable even though he is standing in the woods in a
          suit, tie, and dress shoes. He takes a nice cigar out of his
          pocket, lights it and has a real moment of joy. He looks up
          to the tops of the trees, then back at the new house. He
          exhales a long deep breath. Then we hear a large truck come
          rumbling in the driveway. He hears it. His face shows that he
          knows the sound immediately.
                         
                         
          EXT. HOUSE DRIVEWAY - DAY
          ABEL comes out of the woods and sees a smaller heating oil
          delivery truck (with the same Standard Heating Oil logo)
          parked in the driveway. His face shows it probably isn't
          great news.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
                         
          ABEL comes down a hallway and then turns through a curtain
          into a treatment area. Sitting on the table is the young
          driver of the truck, JULIAN.
                         
          He has a contraption on his head that is holding his jaw shut
          in place. His eye is black. ABEL goes over and gives him a
          tight hug. But then he ever so slightly checks himself and
          places him back down on the table.
                         
          ABEL looks up and sees ANNA, standing in the corner. She is
          all business. They stare at each other.
                         
                          ANNA
           They broke his jaw.
                         
                          ABEL
           Have they found the truck?
                          12
                         
                         
                          ANNA
           Yes.
                          ABEL
           Are you alright?
                         
                          JULIAN
                          (NODS YES)
                         
                          ABEL
           Have the police been here yet?
                         
                          ANNA
           He was left in the middle of the
           highway without a truck, they
           brought him in.
                         
                          ABEL
           Can you speak?
                         
          ANNA'S temper is rising.
                         
                          ANNA
           Not for a couple days... Can I
           speak with you outside?
          ANNA heads out into the hallway. ABEL looks around a beat
          then follows.
                         
                         
          EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -SAME TIME
                         
          ANNA is waiting in the hallway.
                         
                          ANNA
           Did they sign the contract?
                         
                          ABEL
           Yes.
                         
                          ANNA
           And took the deposit?
                         
                          ABEL
           Yes.
                         
                          ANNA
           So it's a go?
                         
                          ABEL
           (he gives a nice nod yes)
                         
                          ANNA
           Congratulations.
                          13
                         
                         
                          ABEL
           To you as well.
                          ANNA
           We have thirty days?
                         
          He nods ever so slightly yes, and she gives him a knowing
          smile back of equal measure. We are beginning to see that
          they actually work quite well together.
                          ABEL
           These fucking guys. This poor kid
           has been working his ass off.
                         
                          ANNA
           Do you want me to speak to my
           Brother about this?
                         
                          ABEL
           No...don't talk to him or your
           father.
                         
                          ANNA
           This can't continue.
                         
                          ABEL
           It won't.
                         
                          ANNA
           It will if we don't do something.
                         
                          ABEL
           I'm meeting with the D.A. in the
           morning.
                         
                          ANNA
           Oh, fuck the D.A. He's more
           interested in coming after us than
           helping us.
                         
          ABEL looks around in disapproval. She thinks this through and
          then looks in at JULIAN.
                         
                          ANNA (CONT'D)
           It's not fair to them. You're at
           war here.
                         
                          ABEL
           No we are not.
                         
                          ANNA
           Really... because they are.
                          14
                         
                         
                          ABEL
           Well I'm not.
          They look each other over. She then finally leans in and
          gives him a caring kiss, she walks off.
                         
                          ANNA
           And you're going out to check on
           the new house?
                          ABEL
           Yes.
                         
          He watches her walk away then looks back into the hospital
          room. He enters.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
                         
          ABEL walks into the room and looks at JULIAN. He looks up and
          ABEL has trouble putting it to words.
                         
                          ABEL
           I have to get going.
                         
          JULIAN gives a nod.
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           Can we get you anything?
                         
          Nods no.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           We'll pick you up when they let you
           out of here.
                         
          They look at each other.
                         
                          ABEL (CONT'D)
           These men are cowards. Too weak to
           make a living... or even fight with
           their own hands, and too stupid to
           think up anything else to do.
                         
          Finally he turns and leaves.
                         
                         
          EXT. ABANDONED RACETRACK PARKING LOT - QUEENS NY - DAY
                         
          ABEL drives up to the drop off scene. There is the large bulk
          transport truck and one lone police car just sitting in the
          middle of the parking lot.
                          15
                         
                         
          ABEL gets out, walks up, and stops to stare at the truck. A
          young beat cop is sitting on the hood of his car waiting.
                          ABEL
           May I take it?
                         
                          BEAT COP
           Excuse me?
                         
                          ABEL
           May I take it now?
                         
                          BEAT COP
           Is it yours?
                         
                          ABEL
           Yes.
                         
                          BEAT COP
           Well, I'm sorry about that. Once
           the owner or an owner's
           representative files the claim form
           in Corona she's yours... again.
                         
                          ABEL
           So you guys have done what you
           needed to?
                         
                          BEAT COP
           Yes.
                         
                          ABEL
           And what was that?
                         
                          BEAT COP
           I'm sorry?
                         
                          ABEL
           You just said you've done what you
           needed to... so what was it that
           you've done?
                         
                          BEAT COP
           (looks back dumbfounded)
                         
                          ABEL
           Did you fingerprint or anything?
                         
                          BEAT COP
           No need, these guys always wear
           gloves.
                         
                          ABEL
           So you've done nothing.
                          16
                         
                         
                          BEAT COP
           I'm not exactly sure, I just got
           here at four. My shift is actually
           up.
                         
                          ABEL
           So who's coming?
                         
          They stare at each other, then the truck. ABEL then climbs up
          and we see he knows his way around the truck. He goes up top
          and opens and looks into a valve, the tank is empty.
                         
                          BEAT COP
           Sorry.
                         
          The cop gets in his car and prepares to drive away.
                         
           BEAT COP (CONT'D)
           Why did they want it?
                         
                          ABEL
           They stole the $6,000 of fuel that
           was in it.
                         
          The cop leaves. ABEL is left standing on top of the truck in
          the parking lot alone with his battered truck. He looks down
          at the open loading valve and begins to come up with an idea.
          The sun is setting.
                         
                         
          EXT. STANDARD HEATING TRUCK YARD - DAY
                         
          A sign on the inside of the gate reads. ""It's not safety
          first... It's safety always"". The motor on the gate starts in
          and it opens. In drives ABEL'S car.

          ANNA is working away on an adding machine in her office. She
          is listening to the radio that sits behind her on the desk.
          We can see that she is in her comfort zone.

          with confidence and ego to spare. They know each other.

1   TITLES SEQUENCE - MONTAGE WITH SCORE

    PHOTOGRAPHIC STILLS show us NICOLA TOSCANI as a city boy in
    various growing-up SHOTS, circa 1950's -- with street chums
    wearing a Wyatt Earp T-shirt, in a communion suit. Then:
    in his first qi, a youngster studying the martial arts; he
    grows, we see news clippings of him winning trophies, his
    name on contest posters, SHOTS of him in action. Then:
    Japan. Nico now in his teens, studying with real masters,
    being dumped on his butt, posing smiling beside Japanese
    martial artists, then himself as an instructor. Now: a
    few military uniforms enter the picture, we see security
    clearance documents with Nico's picture and name on them.
    Then Nico near draft age with an American friend NELSON
    FOX on some kind of training base. TITLES END.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:
2   EXT. JUNGLE - DAY
    Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT
    CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH.
    SUPER:  Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage
    whips in the fierce downdraft as --
3   ""HUEY"" GUNSHIP
    with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper
    lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the
    wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several
    machine gun positions around the LZ.
4   EXT. JUNGLE - TWO ARMED AMERICANS - DAY
    watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico
    and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary
    jungle attire that usually marks a CIA ""spook.""

5   HELICOPTER
    touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking, in
    their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags
    -- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the
    ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before.

6   LEADER OF THREE

    wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled .45.
7   NICO AND FOX

    don't know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness.

                                                             2.

                                FOX
                  You ever see chemical interrogation
                  before?

     Nico's eyes stay on the approaching ""cowboy,"" KURT ZAGON,
     for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity.
                                NICO
                  These assholes are agency?

8    NICO'S POV
     FOLLOWS the medical bag in the cowboy's hand.

9    BACK TO FOX AND NICO
                                FOX
                  We're all C.I.A. But these guys are
                  from a page that ain't on the map.
10   EXT. JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
     Nico in the point,   leading Fox and the three CIT (Chemical
     Interrogation Team)   men down an unmarked, twisting trail.
     We see from Nico's   gait that he is athletic, a born leader
     and totally at home   in the jungle.
11   TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON
     snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and
     let us know these guys are way out in the boonies.
                                ZAGON
                  How long till we're across the border?
                                NICO
                  We've been over for the past hour.
     The group continues along the ridge.

                                                   CUT TO:
12   EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

     The sky glows from nearby bomb attacks.
13   NICO

     listening hard -- and even sniffing the air -- glances back
     at Zagon, who stands impatiently, drawing on a cigarette.
                                ZAGON
                  What are you looking at, hotshot?

                                NICO
                         (indicates cigarette
                          glow)
                  Why don't you light a bonfire?

                                                         3.

     Irritably, Zagon ditches his smoke.
                             ZAGON
               Just drive the taxi, ace.

     As the party moves out, Fox flashes Nico a look as if to say,
     ""Don't fuck with these guys.""

14   EXT. CAMBODIAN BASE CAMP - NIGHT

     A pocket-fortified position. Armed Cambodian lookouts,
     several hooches, radio equipment. Nico leads the party in
     through the perimeter. Zagon eyes the layout like he's seen
     100 of them. Fox indicates a hooch.
                             FOX
                      (to Zagon)
               They're in there.

     The three CIT men start for the hooch. Nico casts a concerned
     glance around at the base camp troops, looking sloppy as hell.
                             NICO
               I don't trust these yo-yo's.
15   FULL SHOT - BASE CAMP
     We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position
     to another, checking the perimeter. We can vaguely hear him
     ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect.

16   DEFENSIVE POSITION - NICO
     hears a SOUND, looks back toward the hooch.
17   NICO'S POV - HOOCH
     Two Asian prisoners, stripped to the waist, babbling in-
     coherently, are dragged out the back by a pair of Cambodian
     guards and hustled off into the darkness. VOICES can be
     heard inside the hooch. A single lantern glowing inside
     gives the hut a creepy, frightening aspect.

18   BACK TO NICO
     He's extremely uneasy about what's about to happen inside the
     hooch.

19   INT. HOOCH - CLOSE ON RICKETY CARD TABLE - NIGHT
     on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes, drug vials
     and surgical instruments. Zagon's hand picks up a hypodermic,
     squirt-tests it.

                                                          4.

20   TWO ASIAN PRISONERS
     are on their knees, shirtless, handcuffed with heavy nylon
     tape to a stake driven into the ground in the center of the
     hooch. One of the subordinate CIT men moves in, grabs the
     first prisoner by the shoulders. Zagon injects the first
     prisoner. Instantly the man begins shivering, convulsing.
     Zagon watches with professional satisfaction.

                               ZAGON
                 That's the nice thing about modern
                 technology. You don't have to wait
                 for results.

     He moves close to the first prisoner.
                               ZAGON
                        (to first prisoner)
                 Where is it, Charley? You got six tons
                 of our shit --
     The prisoner tries to speak, but he's in such torment all
     that comes out is a blood-curdling wail --
21   EXT. BAST CAMP - NICO

     hears this horrifying cry.   He starts swiftly toward the
     hooch --
22   INT. HOOCH - INTERPRETER

     has moved as close to Zagon and the first prisoner as a fight
     referee to two boxers. The prisoner is convulsing wildly.
     Zagon grabs him fiercely by the hair.
                               ZAGON
                 Don't you die on me, fucker --
                               FOX
                        (from the side)
                 What the hell's wrong?
                               ZAGON
                        (throws the prisoner
                         down)
                 This pussy can't hold his liquor.

     The first prisoner is plainly in a death spasm.

23   NICO
     enters at this point. He takes in the scene quickly, moves
     to a spot beside the entrance. Zagon doesn't look at Nico,
     but it's plain he is aware of Nico's presence. It is as if
     he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove
     it to the others, too.

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                         5.

24   FIRST PRISONER
     dies in agony on the ground.

25   SECOND PRISONER
     watches with eyes like flint. He is in his mid-forties,
     scarred, missing several fingers. Probably a colonel or
     higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round-eyes
     since the French in the 50's. He is plainly one tough
     customer. The second prisoner meets Zagon's eyes, as if
     daring him to use the drugs on him, too. Zagon eyes the
     prisoner with barely contained hatred. The prisoner doesn't
     back down an inch.
                             ZAGON
                      (to second prisoner)
               So my little doctor bag doesn't                      *
               scare you, eh? Well I don't need                     *
               it to open your yap.                                 *
     Zagon reaches to a scabbard on his Western belt, pulls out a
     fearsome serrated blade -- a cross between a bowie knife and
     a scalpel. He steps toward the prisoner, displaying the
     blade in the lantern light.

26   NICO
     watches impassively.
                             ZAGON (O.S.)
                      (to prisoner)
               Where's our load, you sack of slime?
               What did you do with my shit? --
27   ZAGON
     punches  the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife
     handle  in his fist to double the force of the blow and to
     terrify  him with the proximity of the blade. The prisoner
     crashes  sideways, face bloody --
                             ZAGON
               I'm gonna teach you good. I'm gonna
               teach you never to fuck with my
               opium --

28   FOX AND TWO CIT MEN

     seem to know exactly what this is about.
29   NICO

     didn't know, but the new kid on the block is catching on fast.
     Nico has difficulty containing his emotion. Zagon stands
     over the prisoner, as if daring him to get back up.

                                                    6.

The prisoner gets back to his knees, bloody eyes meeting
Zagon's with defiance --

                       ZAGON
                (to prisoner)
         You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy?
         You took it from the Chinks... you took
         it from the French. You'll be fucked
         if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start
         your gums flapping --
Nico watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the
prisoner.

                       ZAGON
         -- Well, you're gonna chirp for me,
         tough guy. You're gonna sing like a
         choir --

Nico takes a step toward Zagon.
                       NICO
         What the fuck does this have to do
         with military intelligence?
                       ZAGON
         Your orders are 'assist and observe'
         cherry --
Zagon turns to face Nico --

                       FOX
                (to Nico)
         Back off, partner --
Zagon turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner,
close as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight.
                       ZAGON
                (to second prisoner)
         I'm gonna start carving at your ankles.
         We'll throw your feet in that box right
         over there. Then I'm gonna take off
         your arms --
One of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping
it to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't
flinched. He seems as locked into this dance of death as
Zagon.
                         NICO
                  (can't take
                   much more)
         Fox --
                       FOX
         Shut up, Nico.

                                                         7.

                             ZAGON
               You can disappear as easy as this
               slope, kid --

     Zagon starts for the prisoner. Here comes the blade.
     Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagon's shoulder. Zagon spins with
     terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at Nico.
     Before Zagon's blow even starts, Nico slams him with a
     ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw. Zagon literally
     comes off the ground, Nico's blow is so terrific. Zagon drops
     in an unconscious heap. In a flash the two other CIT men
     move to jump Nico. Smash! The second CIT man is swallowing
     his teeth. Fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves Nico
     out of the hooch --
30   EXT. HOOCH - NIGHT

     Fox wrestles Nico away from the hooch --

                             FOX
               Are you crazy?!!
                      (as Nico jerks free)
               What the fuck's the matter with you?!!!
     Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps
     away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his
     .45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the
     hooch --
                            FOX
               Nico!
                             NICO
               I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me
               later.

     The last CIT man appears, gun drawn, in the hooch doorway.
     Fox grabs Nico, hauls him back again --

                             FOX
               I'll cover this. Get back to the
               L.Z. --
                      (as Nico resists)
               -- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the
               fuck outa here!
     The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect,
     pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to
     seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect,
     apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The
     troops, confused, hold up for a moment.

                             FOX
                      (to Nico)
               I'll call for a chopper... get outa
               here!

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        8.

     Nico gives a last look, turns and takes off down the jungle
     trail. Fox seems abandoned. The DISTANT BOMBING CONTINUES.
     Nico disappears into the darkness.

                                                FADE TO BLACK.
     FADE IN ON:

31   CHURCH STEEPLE - DAY

     TILT DOWN to reveal St. Elizabeth's, a huge parish church in
     an Italian/Latino neighborhood in Chicago. The church looks
     festive, we see a few formally-dressed people hurrying in,
     then a squad car pulls up. The cops run upstairs as if
     they're late --
32   INT. ST. MARY'S - DAY

     A baptism in progress. Nico -- 15 years older than when we
     last saw him, is standing beside SARA, his lovely wife        *
     -- watching a 60-ish priest, FATHER GENARRO, finish the
     final ritual on Nico's infant son Julian. The priest
     straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth
     around the little fellow's crotch. Smiles from friends and
     relatives clustered proudly around. Several cops, some in
     uniform are amongst them. Nico grabs his son from Genarro
     with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's
     garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt. Laughter from
     all as Nico holds the lad high and proud. He puts his arm
     around Sara.                                                  *

33   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
     Huge trays of Italian delicacies are carried out into the
     sunlight by several ""old country""-type women. Wine is
     poured from generous carafes. Friends and relatives are
     everywhere, laughing and enjoying themselves; apparently
     the party has come here straight from the church. Presents
     for the new baby are being opened by Nico's wife, Sara,        *
     and Nico's mother, ROSA.
                             SARA                                   *
               Mama, look at this -- all done by hand.

     Sara lifts a cute baby outfit.                                 *
                             ROSA
               Nico had one just like this.   Thank
               you, Cora.
     Cora, an aunt, proudly smiles.

34   NICO

     Holding the baby. Realizes that his little son has pooped
     in his pants. He turns for help to Sara.                       *

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                           9.

                                NICO
                  I think we got a little problem here.

                                SARA                                  *
                         (winking at the women)
                  I carried him for the last nine months,
                  you take him for the next diaper.

     Assorted uncles and aunts watch with amusement as Nico tries
     awkwardly to deal with the problem.
                                NICO
                         (to all)
                  That's what you get for not marrying a
                  Sicilian.
     Sara lets Nico struggle a moment, then takes over.               *

                             SARA                                     *
               My brave husband. He's not afraid of
               thieves and muggers, but he's terrified
               when his son poops in his pants.
     Toscani relatives look on with approval at the happy couple
     and their baby.

35   ANOTHER PART OF BACK YARD
     Three Chicago cops, LUKICH and HENDERSON in plain clothes
     and LIEUTENANT STROZAH in uniform wolf some Italian goodies
     while eying the group of celebrating relatives.
                                LUKICH
                         (indicates Nico
                          across the patio)
                  Toscani holds the record... for havin'
                  more relatives under federal indictment
                  than any other cop in Chicago.

36   TWO OF NICO'S UNCLES
     BRANCA and LUIGI, who   look like they have been on the other
     side of a cop's work,   are in turn eying Lukich and Henderson
     -- plus a cluster of   other cops in civvies hovering around
     the buffet table like   vultures.
                                BRANCA
                  Look at these stiff dicks. A free meal
                  and they come out like flies.
37   STREET OUTSIDE NICO'S HOUSE - DAY

     An unmarked police car pulls up. DOLORES JACKSON (""Jax""),
     another undercover cop, tall, black, and elegant, enters
     the driveway leading to Nico's back yard --

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                         10.

38   BACK YARD
     Jackson enters. She's impeccably dressed and radiates
     intelligence. She's greeted warmly by Lukich, Henderson,
     Strozah, and a couple of other cops.
                               STROZAH
                 I didn't do nothing, Counselor.    I'm
                 clean.

                               JACKSON
                 Eight more days, Lieutenant. You
                 better start preparing your defense.

                               HENDERSON
                 Baby, I'm gonna put you on retainer.

                               LUKICH
                 You passed the bar? I make it a
                 point never to pass the bar.
     Jackson sees Nico and Sara across the yard, waves and          *
     starts toward them --
39   BACK TO BRANCA AND LUIGI

     Luigi indicates Jackson as she crosses the patio.
                                 LUIGI
                 Now this cop.    She can bust me any
                 day.
40   NICK, SARA AND ROSA (NICO'S MOTHER)                            *
     Jackson comes up, makes a theatrical appreciation of Nico's
     stylish attire, kisses Sara and greets Nico's mom warmly.      *
     She starts oohing and ahhing over the baby.
41   VARIOUS SHOTS

     Young kids playing on the lawn, more guests arriving, Father
     Genarro dancing with an elderly matron. We see that Nico's
     friends are an electric mix. Cops, art-y types, people of
     varied ages and professions.
42   BACK TO JACKSON

     Holding the baby.

                               JACKSON
                 Look at this little bundle.    What a
                 cupcake!

                               NICO
                 You give up being the D.A. and hurry
                 up and find the right fella, Jax.
                 You might have time for one of these
                 yourself.

              Nico, will you let the woman
              catch her breath?

43   JAPANESE WOMAN (DR. WATANABE)                                  *
     moves in shyly on the fringe of the cluster. While Jackson
     and Sara continue their ""mom"" talk, Nico edges off toward      *
     Watanabe, shaking her hand with real pleasure.                 *

                             NICO
              Watanabe!   Say hey, Doc.

     They begin jabbering in Japanese.
     We will meet Watanabe again later. She's a brainy-looking      *
     woman -- reserved, a bit mysterious -- who talks quietly and   *
     intensely in Japanese with Nico like they're old friends who
     go back a long way.

44   EXT. TOSCANI FRONT PORCH - LATER
     Branca, Luigi and several other Toscani patriarchs smoke
     cigars and sip beer in a cluster. Nico holds Julian.

                            BRANCA
              You're a father now. Are you gonna
              take me up on my offer?

                            NICO
              I'm happy, Branca.    I like what I do.
     Branca glances seriously to the other uncles, then, with a
     smile, pats Nico's cheek.
                            BRANCA
              Look at this face! Six-foot-four,
              pretty as the statue of David. And
              he's a cop!
     Branca laughs. From a distance, Watanabe watches, missing
     nothing. Across the porch, Lukich and several other cops
     observe and try to listen.
                            BRANCA
              This face should be sticking up from
              a white shirt. It should be a banker,
              a businessman, someone who earns a
              decent living for his family!
                             NICO
              We're happy.

              Nickels and dimes. Your wife's a
              woman with class. What did she run
              -- a ballet school...?
                            NICO
              An art gallery.
                            BRANCA
              Same thing. She wants a husband who
              carries a briefcase, not a shoulder
              holster.
     Jackson watches Nico trying to keep his good humor. This
     is serious stuff, despite the light tone. Branca's eyes
     meet Nico's.

                             NICO
                      (lightly)
               Uncle Gio, that kind of help I don't
               need. I'd rather get shot by someone
               I don't know.
     Jackson and Lukich crack up. The others follow.   For the
     moment, the tension is dispelled.

45   INT. NICO'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY
     Nico comes out of the bedroom, adjusting his shoulder
     holster, tugging his jacket over it. He sees his mother
     standing near the head of the stairs, just outside
     another bedroom door. Concern on her face.
                             NICO
               What are you doing in here, Mama?
               Go join the party...
     Nico comes down the hall, tucking in his shirt -- stops
     to give his mother a squeeze. O.S. from the bedroom:
     the sound of QUIET SOBBING. Nico glances in.
46   INT. NURSERY - DAY                                           *
     Sara and another woman sit on the bed, comforting a 60-ish   *
     grandmother Zingaro, who is crying. Nico comes in. He
     kneels before MRS. ZINGARO, concerned.

                             NICO
               Mrs. Z.
                      (tries to be light)
               Is this a way to act on the day of
               my son's baptism?
     The poor woman can't meet Nico's eyes.

                              SARA                                *
               It's Lucy.   She's gone again.
     Nico glances from Sara to Rosa.                              *

     Mrs. Zingaro shakes her head, choked with pain. Nico
     holds her, looking over her shoulder toward Sara.            *
                             NICO
               It's that kid from the bar on Damen?
               The one with the drugs?

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                          13.

     Sara doesn't know. Nico does.     He comforts Mrs. Zingaro   *
     another moment, then stands.

                             NICO
               Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you
               listening?
                      (as the woman nods
                       miserably)
               I have to go to work now. But
               I'll come by tonight. You'll be
               at the bakery?
                               MRS. ZINGARO
               Si, Nico.
                             NICO
               We'll talk, okay? We'll find a
               way to take care of this.

     Nico kisses Mrs. Z. He takes Sara's hand in goodbye,         *
     starts for the door.
47   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - DAY
     Festivities still in progress. Nico passes through,
     nodding, thanking people for coming, taking farewells.
     Jackson waits for him, glancing at her watch.
48   INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING
     Nico is driving.   Jackson checks in on the radio.
                             JACKSON

51   EXT. STREET - BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY                        *
     The unmarked car pulls up outside a liquor store and bar.

52   INT. UNMARKED CAR
     as it parks. Jackson gives Nico a look:     ""What are we
     stopping at this dive for""?

                             NICO
               I gotta take a quick leak. Stay
               put.

     He gets out of the car, starts for the bar.
53   INT. BUCKSHOT'S LIQUORS - DAY                                 *

     Dim, smoke-choked, dangerous characters at the bar.    Nico
     enters.

     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                            15.

     His silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy, working-
     class attire of the bar's denizens. Hard faces check him out
     subtly, ignore him. Nico approaches the bartender, shows a
     photograph. The bartender (BAD DUDE) shakes his head.

                            BAD DUDE                                 *

              leave me alone?                                        *

     He continues mouthing off to Nico. Nico moves to one stool,     *
     then another; the same exchange is repeated.
54   FAVOR ONE PARTICULARLY TOUGH CUSTOMER                           *

     A hulking bruiser with an earring.   He watches as --
55   NICO

     approaches him. Three ARMY JACKETS look up sullenly.
     Beefy arms, tattoos, greasy mustaches.
                              NICO
              Gentlemen.
     One Jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins
     to pick his nose.
                            FIRST ARMY JACKET
                     (to others)
              I thought this was a kosher bar.
              They didn't allow no pork in here.
     The two others snicker, then so does the rest of the bar.
     Nico holds out a photo of a young girl (Lucy).
                            NICO
              You seen this girl?
                            SECOND ARMY JACKET
              I seen the top of her head.
                              NICO
              That's witty.

ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                        15A.

Nico takes a step away, as if moving on to the next
stool. From behind the bar, the bartender swings a          *
sawed-off baseball bat into view. Other bodies move         *
ominously toward Nico. Suddenly he spins and, in a move     *
almost too quick to see, he kicks the entire stool right
out of its floor socket. Beer bottles fly, bodies crash.
Nico slams the First Jacket in the face so hard it looks
like his nose has exploded. Blood sprays onto Nico's silk
shirt. He hauls the Second Jacket upright, nails him with
a shot that crushes three ribs. A savage elbow blasts the
third, head over heels, out over the bar and careening
into the sink. In three seconds 600 pounds of fat has
been put in cold storage. The rest of the bar is on its
feet. Four huge men confront Nico. Now five. Six.
Seven. Nico's jacket and shirt are ripped, blood spat-
tered; his eyes are like an animal's, daring the men --

                         NICO
          Come on.   Show me something.
No one moves.

                I get it.   It's a gay bar.   Is
                that it?

      The men, led by the Bad Dude, are shifting to surround
      Nico. But no one attacks. Nico has Lucy's photo in his
      hand. He jams it in one man's face, then another's, slap-
      ping each one violently, spitting, raging for them to attack.

                              NICO
                You seen the top of her head, huh?
                Like I seen your mother's --
                       (to another guy)
                Or was it yours?
                       (to a third)
                Or yours?
                       (slaps him fero-
                        ciously)
                I couldn't tell, it looked like
                her ass --
      Nico rages like a beast.
                             NICO
               Come on, motherfuckers.    Do it.
               Do it! One man --
      Nico lunges for the Bad Dude, grabs him like he's about
      to tear his face off --
                             BAD DUDE
               Upstairs!
                      (in terror)
               She's upstairs! 4-D!
      Nico drags the Dude from behind the bar.     Holding him,
      Nico turns, glowering, to all.
                             NICO
               You cocksuckers are brave enough
               with 14-year-old girls.
55A   INT. FLOPHOUSE HALLWAY

      Nico throws Bad Dude down the hallway in front of him.
56    INT. FOURTH-FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY

      The door bursts in from a jackhammer kick. Nico stands
      in the hallway. Bad Dude stands next to him; hurt,
      shaking.

                              NICO

A young PIMP -- quite  handsome in a boyish way -- stares up
in panic from a grimy  mattress on the floor. Little LUCY
is in bra and panties,  strung out, 14 and beautiful.
Syringes and free-base  paraphernalia are on a table.

Nico comes in, eyes taking in everything.

                              PIMP
               Wait, man.   It ain't like it
               looks --

     Nico grabs the Pimp by the scruff of the neck, lifting him
     bodily. Lucy starts wailing in horror. Nico smashes the
     Pimp's face down into a mirror with white powder on the
     table --

                             NICO
               That's two years.
     He jerks the Pimp back, rips open a drawer.    More pills
     and glacene bags.
                             NICO
               That's four.

                       neck toward   Lucy)
               She'll get you eight   more. And
               I'm just warming up   --
     Lucy is crying hysterically. Nico flings the Pimp, face          *

Blue, deep and featureless, the twilight of five hundred feet down.
PROPELLER SOUND.  Materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but
sleek form of an Ohio-class SSBN ballistic missile submarine.

INT. U.S.S. MONTANA -- DAY                                              4

In the attack center, darkened to womb-red, the crew's faces shine with sweat
in the glow of their instruments.  The SKIPPER and his EXEC crowd around
BARNES, the sonarman.

                                CAPTAIN
                Sixty knots?  No way, Barnes... the reds don't
                have anything that fast.

                                BARNES
                Checked it twice, skipper.  It's a real unique
                signature.  No cavitation, no reactor noise...
                doesn't even sound like screws.

He puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to
the intruder's acoustic signature, a strange THRUMMING.  The captain studies
the electronic position board, a graphic representation of the contours of
the steep-walled canyon, a symbol for the Montana, and converging with it, an
amorphous trace, representing the bogey.

                                CAPTAIN
                What the hell is it?

                                EXEC
                I'll tell you what it's not, it's not one of
                ours.

                Eighty knots...

                                BARNES
                Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port
                clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.

                clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.

Tension builds in the attack room as the Montana surges to intercept the
intruder.  The exec tensely watches the vector-graphic readout for the side-
scan sonar array.  The sub is running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls.

                                EXEC
                          (low, to Captain)

Suddenly the control room lights dim almost to blackness.

We see only the effect, not the source, as a large diffuse light passes
rapidly under the sub's hull.  Moments later a shockwave, like an underwater
sonic boom, impacts the sub, slamming it sideways.

The cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the port bow with
nightmarish slow-motion.  The sub slams into it with horrific force, scraping
along and bouncing off.  One tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw
prangs the wall with an earsplitting K-K-KWANG!

INT. PORT TO TORPEDO ROOM                                               8

hatches.  Two-foot thick columns of water, like fire-hoses of the gods,
blast into the room.  Everything vanishes instantly in white spray.

INT. CONTROL RM/ATTACK CENTER                                           9

Everyone is hurled off his feet.  The planesman flights to recover control of

The great sub is being hauled down by the mass of its flooded bow section,
its flanks rushing past us like a freight train headed for Hell.

INT. MONTANA CONTROL ROOM                                               11

The command crew fights futility for control, everyone shouting and terrified.

The Captain locks eyes with the Exec amid the din...

                                CAPTAIN
                We're losing her.  Launch the buoy!

The Exec opens the door to a small box and punches a button.  A red light
comes on.  The Captains takes a deep breath.

EXT. MONTANA                                                            12

A tiny transmitter is ejected from the sub's hell and begins its long ascent
to the surface.  A second later the sub slams down like a piledriver onto a
ledge, tearing open its pressure hull.

INT. MONTANA                                                            13

VARIOUS QUICK CUTS, just flashes and impressions, as...
Seawater blasts down the corridors --
Explodes across the control room, hurling men like dolls --
Floods the cavernous missile bay in seconds --
Bursts through hatches into the reactor room --
Blasts men OUT OF FRAME in a micro-second.

EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER                                                   14

In the cobalt twilight we see the Montana slide down the sea cliff, its hull
SCREECHING like the death agonies of some marine dinosaur.  Descending in an
avalanche of silt, it finally disappears into the blackness below... a
blackness which continues almost straight down, 20,000 feet to the bottom of
the Cayman Trough.  The abyss.

EXT. OCEAN SURFACE -- DAY                                               15

Above, in the world, the Caribbean rolling gray under a stormy sky.  The
Montana's emergency buoy pops to the surface, transmitting.

LONG LENS SHOT: three massive Navy Sea King helicopters thundering straight
at us, FILLING FRAME.

REVERSE, as they barrel OVER CAMERA toward a lone civilian ship... an ugly
but very sophisticated deep-sea drilling support ship, the BENTHIC EXPLORER.
It is a twin-hulled monstrosity with a central opening in its deck, around
which crouch enormous cranes, winches and other arcane equipment.

The first Sea King settles onto the helipad, disgorging a contingent of Naval
officers, technicians, and a squad of armed seamen.  A pantomime in the
rotorwash, we see the Benthic Petroleum ""company man"" KIRKHILL greeting
COMMODORE DEMARCO, the on-scene commander.

INT. BENTHIC EXPLORER/BRIDGE -- DAY                                     17

The bridge is state-of-the-art, with computers and sophisticated navigation
and communications gear, looking like mission control with its bank of video
monitors.  The Drilling Operations Supervisor, LELAND MCBRIDE, and BENDIX,
the crew chief, watch the invaders swarming the deck below.

                                MCBRIDE
                Does not look good at all.

TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN (MINUTES LATER) showing divers working in total
blackness around some sort of installation on the bottom of the ocean.  They
move through the harsh floodlights in dreamlike slow motion, looking like
space-suited figures with their helmets and umbilical hoses.

                                DEMARCO (V.O.)
                No light from the surface.  How deep are they?

                Seventeen hundred feet.

WIDER, showing the Navy contingent crowding the control room.  DeMarco is
hardcore military, brusque and efficient.  Kirkhill is a small man with
pinched features, wearing a shirt and tie, which on a drill ship means
company man and/or dickhead.

                                DEMARCO
                I need them to go to over two thousand.

                                KIRKHILL
                They can do it.

1700 FEET BELOW.  A submersible oil-drilling platform, DEEPCORE II, an island
of light in the vast blackness.  Its main framework connects two ""tri-
modules"" consisting of three cylinders each.  These contain living and work
areas in a pressurized environment.  An umbilical cable, thick as a man's
thigh, runs up from the oil rig into the darkness, to the Benthic Explorer
at the surface.  In a bubble-like dome port window we see the rig foreman, or
""toolpusher,"" BUD BRIGMAN.  He's talking (via headset) with two divers
working outside... 'CATFISH' DE VRIES, AND LEW 'BIRD-DOG' FINLER.

                                BUD
                Hey, you guys are milking that job.

Bud turns from the window and crosses the drill floor.  The working heart of
the rig.  THUNDEROUS MECHANICAL ROAR.  The drill crew, in hardhats and mud-
plastered overalls, tend the massive spinning turn-table in the center of the
chamber.  The semi-automated system requires only five men to operate.  The
others are LUPTON MCWHIRTER, DWIGHT PERRY, JAMMER WILLIS, and TOMMY RAY
DIETZ.  Bud hears his names called above the din by Jammer, a massive
roughneck/diver who stands a good head taller than the rest.

                                JAMMER
                               (yelling)
                Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call
                from topside.  That new company man.

                                BUD
                Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from
                a rathole.  Hey, Perry!

One of the roustabouts, a wiry Texan, turns to him.

                                BUD
                Do me a favor and square away the mud hose and
                those cable slings.  This place is starting to
                look like my apartment.

Perry chuckles and sets to the task cheerfully.  Bud EXITS, ducking his head
through a low watertight hatch.

INT. CORRIDOR/TOOLPUSHER'S OFFICE                                       21

Bud tromps down the narrow corridor, his work boots gonging on steel.

                                P.A. (HIPPY'S VOICE)
                BUD, PICK UP THE TOPSIDE LINE URGENT.

                                BUD
                I'm coming.  Keep your pantyhose on.

He enters his office, a tiny cubicle with stacks of paperwork, dust-
gathering tech manuals and waterstained Penthouse fold-outs.  He picks up the
phone... punches down a line.

                                BUD
                Brigman here.  Kirkhill?  What's going on?
                              (pause)
                I am calm.  I'm a calm person.  Is there some
                reason why I shouldn't be calm?

HOLD ON Bud's expression, darkening, as he listens.

INT. CORRIDOR/CONTROL MODULE                                            22

The control module is a long narrow cabin like the inside of a Winnebago,
packed with instrumentation.  At the end is a small bay with multiple
viewports.  Outside, at a 'Christmas tree' pipe installation, a lone diver
can be seen welding.  He is accompanied by a large submersible, FLATBED, and
by a Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, call LITTLE GEEK.  Little Geek is an
underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable-like control TETHER.
It has a single video 'eye' in front, by which the operator pilots the little
machine.  The rig's ROV pilots is ALLEN 'HIPPY' CARNES, who stands by the
window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee.  His pet white rat,
BEANY, crawls contentedly around his shoulders.  The door BANGS OPEN.

Hippy jumps, slops his coffee.  Bud strides in.  Not calm.

                                BUD
                Son of a bitch.

He kicks a chair out of the way and slams his palm down on a switch marked
DIVER RECALL.  A SIREN, blasting through the water from a big hydrophone
loudspeaker.

                                BUD
                All divers.  Drop what you're doing.  Everybody
                out of the pool.

EXT. DEEPCORE/CHRISTMAS TREE                                            A22

Flatbed's pilot, LISA 'ONE NIGHT' STANDING, can be clearly seen behind a
bubble canopy.  She is a no-nonsense lady who holds her own in the mostly
male environment by being one of the best submersible drivers in the
business.  She controls a hydraulic manipulator arm, assisting the diver,
ARLISS 'SONNY' DAWSON, in his work.  Little Geek hovers around them like a
tiny helicopter.  One Night moves the Flatbed arm to Sonny and hands him the
pipe.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Here you go, hon'.

                                SONNY
                Just in time, sugar.

They react to Bud's recall, looking toward him up in the control module.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Dammit, we just got out here.

                                SONNY
                There was a time when I would have asked why.

One Night makes a grab for his butt with the manipulator claw, which he
narrowly avoids.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER SUB-BAY                                             23

Flatbed moves underneath the rig, a few feet above the seafloor, with Sonny
riding on its top deck.  It passes under a lit opening and rises toward the
surface of the water in the chamber above.  Little Geek follows like an
obedient dog.

INT. SUB-BAY/MOONPOOL                                                   24

The opening is called the moonpool, and Deepcore's submersibles are launched
through it.  From inside the sub-bay it looks just like a swimming pool.
Flatbed surfaces, nearly filling it.  The chamber also contains CAB ONE, a
similar submersible.  Jammer, Perry, and some of the other drill-room boys
are helping the divers out of the water.  The water at this depth is only
about six degrees above freezing, and these folks are cold and prune-
fingered.  Finler pulls off his demand-helmet, revealing a round, boyish
face.

                                FINLER
                What's goin' on?  How come we got recalled?

                                SONNY
                Hell is I know.

One Night jumps 'ashore' from Flatbed's broad deck and joins them.  Catfish
is unzipping his bulky dry-suit.

                                CATFISH
                Just follow standard procedure, will ya...
                flog the dog till somebody tells us what's
                happening.

                                JAMMER
                Hey, Catfish, I'll sell you my October Penthouse
                for twenty bucks.

                                ONE NIGHT
                Save you money, darlin'... the pages are all
                stuck together by now.

Bud enters, approaching the group.

                                JAMMER
                What's goin' on, Boss?

                                BUD
                Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole
                and prepare to move the rig.

                                SONNY
                She-hit.

                                BUD
                We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of
                national security.  Now you know exactly as much
                as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to
                control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten
                minutes.

                                                                CUT TO:

The whole rig crew is somehow jammed into the room for the video briefing.
DeMarco is on the main monitor, with his aides and Kirkhill visible b.g.

                                DEMARCO
                At 09:22 local time this morning, an American
                nuclear submarine, the USS Montana, with 156 men
                aboard, went down 22 miles from here.  There has
                been no contact with the sub since then.  The
                cause of the incident is not known.

PAN AROUND the reactions of the various drill crew members... shocked,
hushed, curious.

                                DEMARCO
                Your company has authorized the Navy's use of
                this facility for a rescue operation.  The code
                name is Operation Salvor.

                                ONE NIGHT
                You want us to search for the sub?

                                DEMARCO
                No.  We know where it is.  But she's in 2000 feet
                of water and we can't reach her.  We need divers
                to enter the sub and search for survivors, if
                any.

Bud's scowl has been deepening since DeMarco started to talk.

                                BUD
                Don't you guys have your own stuff for this type
                of thing?

                                DEMARCO
                By the time we get our rescue submersible here
                the storm front will be right on us.  But you
                can get your rig in under the storm and be on-
                site in fifteen hours.  That makes you our best
                option right now.

Hippy, born suspicious and recently graduated to paranoid, leans forward...

                Why should we risk our butts on a job like this?

                I have been authorized to offer you all special-
                duty bonuses equivalent to three times normal

                Hell, for triple time I'd crawl through razor

                I'm here to tell ya', you could set me on fire

                Look, I don't know what kind of a deal you guys
                worked out with the company, but my people are

                                DEMARCO
                A four-man SEAL team will transfer down to you
                to supervise the operation.

                                BUD
                You can send down whoever you like, but I'm the
                toolpusher on this rig, and when it comes to the
                safety of these people, there's me... then
                there's God.  Understand?  If things get dicey,

Bud stands beside the hatchway as the others file out toward their tasks.
They comment gravely as they pass...

                When Lindsey finds out about this, it's not

                                ONE NIGHT
                They're going to have to shoot her with a
                tranquilizer gun.

A single Navy Sea King churns through the rain under massive thunderheads.
The sea below is whipped by the storm.

INT./EXT. SEA KING                                                      28

PANNING ALONG BOOTED FEET, four pairs of black military size twelves line
up, onto... a pair of Charles Jourdans fives under shapely ankles.

WIDER, revealing the four-man team of Navy SEALs.  And a slender woman in
her early thirties.  She's attractive, if a bit hardened, dressed
conservatively in a skirt and jacket.  Meet LINDSEY.  Project Engineer for
Deepcore.  She's a pain in the ass, but you'll like her.  Eventually.
She's holding on grimly, sitting crammed in with the SEALs and a bunch of
gear, getting tossed around by the storm.  The SEALs are dressed alike in
black fatigues.  They are muscular, finely-tuned and extremely dangerous
special-forces types.  The leader of the SEAL team, LIEUTENANT COFFEY, makes
his way forward to the cockpit.

The pilot is white-knuckling his stick, trying to hold the great beast of a
helicopter in position.  Through the windshield, the deck of the Benthic
Explorer can be seen below, pitching in a violent sea.

                                PILOT
                No way I'm putting her down.  I shouldn't even
                be flying in this shit.

                                COFFEY
                                (cool)
                Just hold it over the deck.

Coffey goes back to the crew deck, moving easily in the bucking craft.  He
nods to the others SEALs, MONK, WILHITE, and SCHOENICK.  In the open side
door, Wilhite clips a 100 foot nylon rope to the airframe and throws out the
coil.  One by one the shoulder the gear-bags, grab the rope, and step out.
Lindsey stands swaying in the chopper door, watching the SEALs fast-roping
to the deck.  One, two, three.  Coffey looks at her.

                                COFFEY
                You want to be on that ship, there's only one
                way it's going to happen.

He's sure she won't go for it.  It's his certainty that gets her.  She sets
her jaw.  Opening her purse she takes out a small plastic bag, puts her
shoes and purse in the bag, and grips the bag in her teeth.  Then grabs
the rope and slides down.

EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER/HELIPAD                                           29

Swinging wildly in the wind like a human pendulum, Lindsey fast-ropes forty
feet to the deck.  She steps away an instant before Coffey hits behind her.
Lindsey crosses the rainswept deck with athletic strides.  Her nylons are
ruined.  An air-crewman in the chopper lowers two additional equipment cases
using the rescue sling.  The SEALs catch them as they swing radically across
the deck.  They Navy chopper banks and seems to scurry away before the
mounting storm.

BLACKNESS.  Then shafts of light become visible, above a ridge of rock.
Flatbed appears, trailing two heavy two cables.  Behind it, the mass of
Deepcore emerges from the darkness, its forward lighting array blazing.
Flatbed is towing it like a tug, aided by Deepcore's own mighty stern
thrusters.

INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            31

Bud, his feet propped up, uses joystick controls to 'fly' Deepcore,
maneuvering against currents and around seafloor obstacles.  He is guided
by the side-scan sonar display, with Hippy assisting in the sonar shack.
Through the front viewport, Flatbed can be seen out ahead.

McBride appears on the bridge monitor, holding a sheet of weather-fax.

                                MCBRIDE (on screen)
                Well, it's official, sportsfans.  They're calling
                it Hurricane Frederick, and it's going to be
                making our lives real interesting in a few hours.

INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                             32

Bud responds via video.

                                BUD
                Fred, huh?  I don't know.  Hurricanes should be
                named after women.

McBride looks up as the bridge door opens.  Lindsey enters in a blast of wind,
wet as a wharf rat and twice as pissed off.  Maybe Bud is right.

                                                                CUT TO:

Bud is surprised to see Lindsey's face appear on the monitor screen.

                                LINDSEY
                I can't believe you let them do this!

                                BUD
                     (unpreturbed, almost cheerful)
                Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.

                                LINDSEY
                I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last
                flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left
                it, is it, Bud?

                                BUD
                Wasn't up to me.

                                LINDSEY
                We were that close to proving a submersible
                drilling platform could work.  We had over seven
                thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I
                can't believe you let them grab my rig!

                                BUD
                Your rig?

                                LINDSEY
                My rig.  I designed the damn thing.

                                BUD
                Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long
                as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they
                tell me.

                                LINDSEY
                You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They
                bought you... more like least rented you cheap--

                                BUD
                I'm switching off now.

                                LINDSEY
                Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up
                to fight.  You--

Bud hits the switch and the screen goes dead.

                                BUD
                Bye.

Hippy looks over him, trying very hard not to crack up.

                                HIPPY
                Virgil?

                                BUD
                God, I hate that bitch.

                                HIPPY
                Yeah, well you never should have married her then.

Bud nods fatalistically.

                                                                CUT TO:

EXT. EXPLORER DECK/LAUNCH WELL                                          34

Ten foot waves crash through the launch-well, sending up geysers of spray.
Next to the launch-well, crewman have attached a lifting cable to CAB THREE,
eighteen feet of ugly yellow submersible.  It slams violently in its steel
cradle as the drill-ship rolls.  Coffey and Schoenick hand the gear bags in
to Wilhite and Monk though the hatch under the rear of the submersible.

Lindsey approaches, wearing a borrowed roustabout's coverall.

She looks down at the larger of the two equipment cases brought by the SEALs,
lying on the deck.  Stenciled on it are the words: F.B.S./DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.
Coffey and Schoenick push past her to pick it up.

                                LINDSEY
                Let's go, gentlemen!  We either launch now or
                we don't launch.

Coffey looks up in surprise as she nimbly climbs the side of Cab Three and
grabs the lifting shackle, circling her raised hand to signal the crane man.

                                LINDSEY
                Take her up, Byron!

Cab Three, with Lindsey riding its back, is pulled up out its cradle and
starts to swing violently as Explorer pitches.  The submersible is then
swung out to the center of the launch well.  It sways and gyrates above the
furious water below.  Lindsey drops into the upper hatch.

Kirkhill leans suddenly over the console to look out the window.

                What the hell is she doing out there?  Son of a

                her down.

Lindsey pulls her headset as she dogs down the inside locking levers of the
hatch.

                                LINDSEY
                Bates is sick.  Besides I've got more hours in
                this thing than he does.
                              (to Coffey)
                A little change of plan.

The little sub is swinging like a pendulum on the cable, and the SEALs,
jammed in with their equipment in the tiny space, are getting slammed into
the walls.  Lindsey is calmly flipping switches as she talks.

                                COFFEY
                Lady, we better fish or cut bait.

                                LINDSEY
                Just hold your water, okay?
                             (to Kirkhill)
                So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk
                about it?

The plug is pulled on DeMarco's patience.

                                DEMARCO
                I don't care who drives the damn thing.  Just get
                my team in the water.

                                KIRKHILL
                Alright, alright.  Christ Almighty!

He gestured dismissively to McBride.

                                MCBRIDE
                Cab Three, you are clear to launch.

INT./EXT. CAB THREE                                                     38

Lindsey reaches up a grabs a red lever.

                                LINDSEY
                Roger.

                There's only one way it's going to happen...

She pulls the lever hard.  CLUNK-CLANG!  The shackle-release drops the sub.
It freefalls ten feet to the water with an enormous splash and keeps right
on going after Lindsey floods the trim tanks.  Coffey et al have been slammed
hard.

                                LINDSEY
                Touchdown.  The crowd goes wild.  Explorer...

               Eighteen combat-ready special forces, wearing assault black,

               greasy ramp into the night sky.  Village lights flicker 19,000

               A military GUARD, old Soviet-style uniform, rounds the corner 
               of the large estate toting an AK-47.

               A red laser dot appears briefly on his forehead and, after a 
               beat, the red dot seems to bleed.  The Guard collapses dead.  
               Two other GUARDS are dispatched with single, silenced shots.

               A Strike Team member at a junction box awaits a signal.

               Through infra-red binoculars the strike Force Leader watches 
               his assault troops as they take positions.

               The soldiers pull Stravanavitch to his feet and haul him out 
               of the room.

               FOLLOWING -  As they push down the hallway.

               MANSION SECURITY GUARDS rally with haphazard gunfire.

               Out come the strike force's flash-bang grenades.  Exploding 
               everywhere, disorienting Stravanavitch's men.

               Signal flares burn as a helicopter descends on the position.  
               The Strike Team evacuates across the field and forces a 
               struggling Stravanavitch into the low-hovering copter.

               The commandos swiftly board the craft as a handful of

               years in office.

               This man is JAMES MARSHALL, and he is the PRESIDENT of the 
               UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  He busily makes last minute changes 
               to his speech.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                              (V.0. earpiece)
                         Has chosen to join our fight against 
                         tyranny in forging a new world 
                         community.  Ladies and gentlemen, I 
                         give you the President of the United 
                         States of America...

               Mr. President.

               Thunderous applause as Marshall rises and approaches the 
               podium.

               At the back of the room, DOHERTY, a senior policy adviser 
               whispers to the President's Chief of Staff ED SHEPHERD...

                                     DOHERTY
                         Maybe we should consider running him 
                         for re-election instead of the U.S.

               The applause dies as Marshall begins to speak.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (in Russian with 
                              subtitles)
                         Good evening and thank you.  First I 
                         would ask you to join me in a moment 
                         of silence for the victims of the 
                         Turkmenistan massacres.

               The room remains silent a few beats.  Most guests respectfully 
               bow their heads.

               Marshall begins again, but this time in English.  The young 
               woman translates simultaneously for the Russian audience.

                                     MARSHALL
                         As you know, three weeks ago American 
                         Special Forces, in cooperation with 
                         the Russian Republican Army, secured 
                         the arrest of Turkmenistan's self-
                         proclaimed dictator, General Ivan 
                         Stravanavitch, whose brutal sadistic 
                         reign had given new meaning to the 
                         word horror.  I am proud to say our 
                         operation was a success.

               Applause from the audience.  Marshall turns the page on his 
               speech.

                                     MARSHALL
                         And now, yesterday's biggest threat 
                         to world peace... today awaits trial 
                         for crimes against humanity.

               During the applause, Marshall pulls a page from the speech, 
               folds it and slides it into his pocket.  He removes his 
               glasses and looks out into the crowd.  His tone becomes more 
               personal.

               He's not reciting the speech anymore.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What we did here was important.  We 
                         finally pulled our heads out of the 
                         sand, we finally stood up to the 
                         brutality and said ""We've had enough.  
                         Every time we ignore these atrocities-- 
                         the rapes, the death squads, the 
                         genocides- every time we negotiate 
                         with these, these thugs to keep them 
                         out of gig country and away from gig 
                         families, every time we do thiS.E. 
                         we legitimize terror.

               Terror is not a legitimate system of government.  And to 
               those who commit the atrocities I say, we will no longer 
               tolerate, we will no longer negotiate, and we will no longer 
               be afraid.  It's your turn to be afraid.

               Applause rolls through the crowd.

               EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

               Sprawling terminals spread out to runways like tentacles.

               ON THE TARMAC -

               Bathed in floodlights, perched majestically on the runway, 
               dwarfing nearby commuter and military jets, stands...

                                     AIR FORCE ONE
                         The President's own Boeing 747-200, 
                         dubbed ""the flying White House"".  
                         The distinctive royal blue stripe 
                         over a thin gold line tapers to a 
                         tail adorned with the American flag 
                         and the Presidential Seal Secret 
                         Service agents and Marines stand 
                         guard at the aircraft's perimeter.

               A RUSSIAN NEWS VAN emerges from the darkness and pulls to a 
               stop by a Secret Service barricade.

               SPECIAL AGENT GIBBS greets the Russian news team that emerges.

                                     GIBBS
                         Gentlemen, welcome to Air Force One.

               Please present your equipment to Special Agent Walters for 
               inspection.

               The news team's segment producer, a crusty old Russian named 
               KORSHUNOV raises his big bushy eyebrows.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         We've already been inspected.

                                     GIBBS
                         Sir, this plane carries the President 
                         of the United States.

               Though we wish to extend your press service every courtesy, 
               you will comply with our security measures to the letter.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Of course.  I'm sorry.

               Korshunov and the FIVE MEMBERS of his news crew present their 
               video cameras, sound equipment and supplies to Special Agent 
               WALTERS for inspection.  Secret Service DOGS sniff through 
               the baggage.

                                     GIBBS
                         Please place your thumbs on the ID 
                         pad.

               Korshunov puts his thumb on the ID pad of a portable computer.

               The computer matches up his thumbprint with his dossier and 
               photograph.  ""CLEARED"" flashes on the computer screen.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               The President, walking with his entourage.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         *                     CBS said they'll 
                         give us four minutes.  They thought 
                         the Russian was a nice touch.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I always wondered if my freshman 
                         Russian class would come in handy.

                                     DOHERTY
                         Sir, you threw out page two.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a 
                         tough-as-nails speech and you gave 
                         me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the 
                         point in having a speech if I have 
                         to ad-lib?

                                     DOHERTY
                         It was a good ad-lib, sir.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Thanks.  Wrote it last night.

               The President exits the building and enters his limousine.

               EXT. TARMAC - AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Walters hands the bags back to the Russians.

                                     WALTERS
                         Equipment checks out.

               A striking woman in her early thirties descends Air Force 
               One's stairway.  MARIA MITCHELL.

                                     GIBBS
                         Gentlemen, this is Maria Mitchell.

               Press Relations for the Presidential Flight Office.  She'll 
               take you from here.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally 
                         meet you in person.

                                     MITCHELL
                         The President and I were delighted 
                         that we could accommodate you.  Now 
                         if you're all cleared?
                              (Gibbs nods)
                         You can follow me then.

               They ascend into the belly of Air Force One.

                                     MITCHELL
                         *                    I'll be giving 
                         you a brief tour, then during the 
                         flight, two members of your crew 
                         will be allowed out of the press 
                         area at a time for filming.  You 
                         will have exactly ten minutes with 
                         the President and twenty with the 
                         crew...

               EXT. STREETS OF MOSCOW, PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE - NIGHT

               Winding its way down narrow cobblestone streets onto a major 
               thoroughfare.

               INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

               The limousine is packed with advisers, aides, military staff, 
               including LT. COL. PERKINS, the keeper of the NUCLEAR FOOTBALL 
               handcuffed to his wrist.  In the b.g. on the limo's television 
               set, the LARRY KING SHOW indulges in its normal banter.

               Marshall wearily rubs his temples as he stifles a yawn.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         You wanna knock of f?

                                     MARSHALL
                         No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the 
                         Speaker say?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         He and the NRA don't like the wording.

                                     DOHERTY
                         Apparently taking uzis away from 
                         sixth graders isn't as popular as we 
                         thought it'd be.  Representative 
                         Taylor is working on a compromise.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Put together a score sheet.  I'll 
                         make some calls.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         With all due respect, sir, maybe you 
                         should give them this one.  Your 
                         numbers are still pretty low and you 
                         called in a lot of chips to nail 
                         Stravanavitch.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I might still have a few chips left.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         *                     We could always 
                         put you in a duck blind with a twelve 
                         gauge.  The second amendment types'll 
                         love that.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing 
                         a couple ducks won't get it through 
                         committee.  Besides, Shep, I told 
                         you...  I don't shoot babies and I 
                         don't kiss guns.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Other way around, sir.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (realizing what he 
                              said)
                         Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a 
                         favor and keep me away from the press.

               Marshall's watch alarm beeps and he automatically reaches 
               into his breast pocket, pulls out a medicine vial and downs 
               two pills with a coffee chaser.

               On the T.V.

                                     LARRY KING (T.V.)
                         ... and your reaction to the 
                         President's trip to Moscow.  Good or 
                         bad?

               Shepherd turns up the volume.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         This is the part I wanted you to 
                         see.

                                     REP. DANFORTH (T.V.)
                         Criminal.  One of our boys died in 
                         Marshall's little publicity stunt 
                         and for what?  So we could claim 
                         victory over another country's 
                         problems instead of our own?  And 
                         now he's got the nerve to prance 
                         around Moscow gloating, while that 
                         poor boy's family is left to bury 
                         him.  If I were Marshall, I'd be 
                         ashamed of myself.

                                     LARRY KING
                         There you have it.  Harsh words for 
                         the President from Michael Danforth, 
                         the Speaker of the House.

               Marshall mutes the television.  A quiet moment.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         *                     My opinion.  
                         We can't let him get away with that 
                         kind of language.

               Marshall considers.  Then decides.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's bait.  Don't take it.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked 
                         this administration on national 
                         television.  You can't afford to 
                         leave that hanging.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (ignoring Shepherd)
                         Did we tape the Duke game?

                                     AIDE
                         It's waiting on the plane.  The ending 
                         was pretty...

                                     MARSHALL
                              (interrupting)
                         Please don't tell me.  Just for once, 
                         *                     let me be 
                         surprised.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, CORRIDOR, TRAVELING - NIGHT

               Maria Mitchell escorts the Russians down the plane's length.  
               As they pass the galley, Maria motions up a set of stairs.

                                     MITCHELL
                         Up on the upper deck is the cockpit 
                         and the Mission Communication Center.  
                         The MCC, as we call it, can place 
                         clear and secure phone calls to 
                         anywhere on earth.  We're linked to 
                         a network of military and civilian 
                         satellites and ground stations.  We 
                         could run the country or run a war 
                         from there if we had to.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         This is a remarkable aircraft.

                                     MITCHELL
                         You don't know the half of it.  Did 
                         you know this entire plane is shielded 
                         from radiation?  We could fly through 
                         a mushroom cloud completely unharmed 
                         if necessary.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         A dubious distinction, no?

                                     MITCHELL
                         I guess it depends on your 
                         perspective.

               They walk by several conference rooms, running down the 
               starboard side of the plane.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And all these rooms here?

                                     MITCHELL
                         Conference rooms, though some have 
                         other functions.  The one up front 
                         doubles as an emergency medical 
                         center.

               Past the conference rooms, they walk by a small side room 
               where SECRETARIES work on computers, generating documents.

                                     MITCHELL
                         As you can see, back here's more 
                         like a regular plane.  Security and 
                         Secret Service take this cabin.
                         You'll be in the rear with the press 
                         pool.

               The REAR PRESS CABIN, just ahead of the rear galley and bank 
               of bathrooms.  A handful of disgruntled reporters feign sleep.

                                     MITCHELL
                         Here's a press kit.  I'll let you 
                         guys get comfortable and once we're 
                         airborne I'll be able to schedule 
                         the interviews.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Thank you.

               Mitchell exits forward.  One of the reporters stirs and looks 
               up at the news team.  He groans.  Space is a premium back 
               here.

                         You fellas win some sort of fly-with-

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Potus?  What is Potus?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Ah, no.  We won nothing.  We are

                         Right.  Listen, this here... This is 
                         my row.  You'll have to sit over 
                         there.

               Korshunov trades looks with his news team.

               EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

               The President's motorcade pulls up in front of Air Force 
               One.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               The President and his entourage ascend from the lower deck 
               platform onto the main deck.  COL. DANIEL AXELROD, Air Force 
               One's pilot, snaps off a salute as he passes.

                                     COL. AXELROD
                         Welcome aboard, Mr. President.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (returns salute)
                         Hey Danny.  How's it look tonight?

                                     COL. AXELROD
                         Glassy, sir.  Care to take the wheel?

                                     MARSHALL
                         You keep offering, one of these days 
                         I'll take you up on it.
                              (to no one in 
                              particular)
                         Rose and Alice back yet?

                                     AIDE
                         No, Mr. President.  The ballet ran 
                         late.  Their ETA is seventeen minutes.

               Marshall nods as he pulls off his bow tie and enters his 
               stateroom.  Shepherd follows two steps behind.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Mr. President?

               Marshall halts Shepherd with a gesture.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Thirty seconds.

               Shepherd nods and waits by the door.  Lt. Col. Perkins takes 
               a seat outside the Presidents stateroom and opens the latest 
               Tom Clancy thriller, using the nuclear football as a lap 
               desk.

               INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

               Marshall collapses on the couch, rubs his eyes, then closes 
               them.  A moment of peace in a breakneck day.

               The knock at the door jars him.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Yes.

               Shepherd enters.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Can I at least issue a press release 
                         objecting to the Speaker's choice of 
                         wording?

               President Marshall picks up one of the many phones in his 
               office.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I said it's not worth the fight.
                              (into phone)
                         Steward, please.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         We'll just say it was in bad taste.

               *                               MARSHALL

               Forget it, Shep.  The kid gave his life for his country and 
               the

               Speaker's a bastard for turning him into a sound bite.  I'll 
               take the heat.  Understood?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         You give me ulcers.

                                     MARSHALL
                         That's my job.

               A STEWARD enters the room.

                                     STEWARD
                         Mr. President?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Hey Mike.  Could you get me a 
                         Heineken?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         No, wait.  Get him one of the Russian 
                         beers.

               The steward nods and disappears from the room.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         We've got those Russian news guys on 
                         board and it'll look good in the 
                         papers.

               Marshall picks up a stack of policy reports.  Thumbs through 
               them.

                                     MARSHALL
                         C'mon Shep.  I've been eating borscht 
                         and drinking vodka for days.  Isn't 
                         that enough?
                              (off paper)
                         New home starts are down.

               The steward arrives with the Russian beer.  Marshall takes a 
               swig.  He swallows hard.  Piss-water.  Marshall crosses to 
               his sink and pours the beer out.  He hands the bottle to the 
               steward.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Fill this with Heineken.

               The steward nods...

                                     STEWARD
                         Yes, Mr. President.

               AND SLINKS AWAY WITH THE BOTTLE. MARSHALL CATCHES HIMSELF --

                                     MARSHALL
                         I don't believe this.  I'm playing 
                         politics with a bottle of beer.  A 
                         goddamn bottle of beer.  I've been 
                         in office too long.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Look on the bright side... if the 
                         polls don't change, you won't have 
                         that problem, sir.

               Marshall picks up the phone again.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Yeah.  Put the Duke game on in my 
                         room.

               INT. AFO'S MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT

               THREE Air Force SPECIALISTS man the elaborate communication 
               system occupying much of the upper deck.  Top-of-the-line 
               computers, communication systems, video decks, and satellite 
               receivers.

                                     AIR FORCE SPECIALIST
                         Yes, Mr. President.

               He slides in a videotape and channels the feed to the *         
               president's stateroom.

               INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

               A monitor comes to life with a basketball game.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (to Shepherd)
                         Defense and State Department in the 
                         conference room in one hour.  I want 
                         to review the Iraq situation.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Yes, sir.

               Shepherd exits as Marshall settles into his leather chair 
               and dives into work.  He punches a button on the speakerphone.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Get me the Housing Secretary...

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               The Marine Guards snap to attention once again as the First 
               Lady's motorcade arrives.

               ROSE MARSHALL, a self-assured woman with an aristocratic 
               gleam, alights from her limo.  She takes a few steps, then 
               turns, tapping her foot impatiently.

                                     ROSE
                         C'mon Alice, we're 20 minutes late.

               Your father's gonna have a fit.

               ALICE, the President's 13-year-old daughter, straggles out 
               of the car, rolling her eyes.

                                     ALICE
                         It's not like he hasn't made us wait 
                         a few times.

                                     ROSE
                         Well, you aren't the President, dear.

                                     ALICE
                         Yeah, no duh.

               INT. MAIN DECK, AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               As the First Lady's entourage enters.

                                     ROSE
                         Why don't you go say hi?

               Again, Alice rolls her eyes.

                                     ROSE
                         What is wrong with you tonight?  
                         Come here.

               Rose pulls Alice aside.

                Story by Dan O'Bannon & Ronald Shusett


                      Screenplay by Dan O'Bannon





                                                                       1976






                              SYNOPSIS

     En route back to Earth from a far part of the galaxy, the crew of the
     starship SNARK intercepts a transmission in an alien language,
     originating from a nearby storm-shrouded planet.

     Mankind has waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent
     life in the universe -- they decide to land and investigate.  Their
     search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open
     -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange
     things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers.

     Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface
     of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a
     vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb
     full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-
     old spores, which are triggered into life by the men's presence.  A
     parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men's faces -- and
     cannot be removed.

     An examination by the ship's medical computer reveals that the
     creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing
     something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite's blood
     is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not
     kill it on the ship.

     Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship,
     and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal
     themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a
     horrible little monster emerges from the victim's body -- it has been
     growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose
     on the ship.

     A series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft
     and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears
     a man's head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in
     the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific
     windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the
     creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien's
     bizarre life cycle.

     Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the
     creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a
     climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which
     determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.

     FADE IN:

     EXTREME CLOSEUPS OF FLICKERING INSTRUMENT PANELS.  Readouts and digital
     displays pulse eerily with the technology of the distant future.

     Wherever we are, it seems to be chill, dark, and sterile.  Electronic
     machinery chuckles softly to itself.

     Abruptly we hear a BEEPING SIGNAL, and the machinery begins to awaken.
     Circuits close, lights blink on.

     CAMERA ANGLES GRADUALLY WIDEN, revealing more and more of the
     machinery, banks of panels, fluttering gauges, until we reveal:

     INTERIOR - HYPERSLEEP VAULT

     A stainless steel room with no windows, the walls packed with
     instrumentation.  The lights are dim and the air is frigid.

     Occupying most of the floor space are rows of horizontal FREEZER
     COMPARTMENTS, looking for all the world like meat lockers.

     FOOM!  FOOM!  FOOM!  With explosions of escaping gas, the lids on the
     freezers pop open.

     Slowly, groggily, six nude men sit up.

                              ROBY
               Oh... God... am I cold... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Is that you, Roby?

                              ROBY
               I feel like shit... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah, it's you all right.

     Now they are yawning, stretching, and shivering.

                              FAUST
                    (groans)
               Ohh... I must be alive, I feel dead.

                              BROUSSARD
               You look dead.

                              MELKONIS
               The vampires rise from their graves.

     This draws a few woozy chuckles.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (shakes his fist in the
                     air triumphantly)
               We made it!

                              HUNTER
                    (not fully awake)
               Is it over?

                              STANDARD
               It's over, Hunter.

                              HUNTER
                    (yawning)
               Boy, that's terrific.

                              STANDARD
                    (looking around with a grin)
               Well, how does it feel to be rich
               men?

                              FAUST
               Cold!

     This draws a LAUGH.

                              STANDARD
               Okay!  Everybody topside!  Let's get
               our pants on and get to our posts!

     The men begin to swing out of the freezers.

                              MELKONIS
               Somebody get the cat.

     Roby picks a limp cat out of a freezer.

     INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM

     This is a fantastic circular room, jammed with instrumentation.  There
     are no windows, but above head level the room is ringed by
     viewscreens, all blank for the moment.

     There are seats for four men.  Each chair faces a console and is
     surrounded by a dazzling array of technology.

     STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, and MELKONIS are entering and finding their
     seats.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.

                              ROBY
                    (putting down the cat)
               Cattle ranch!

                              BROUSSARD
               I'm not kidding.  You can get one if
               you have the credit.  Look just like
               real cows, too.

                              STANDARD
               All right, tycoons, let's stop
               spending our credit and start
               worrying about the job at hand.

                              ROBY
               Right.  Fire up all systems.

     They begin to throw switches, lighting up their consoles.  The control
     room starts to come to life.  All around the room, colored lights
     flicker and chase each other across glowing screens.  The room fills
     with the hum and chatter of machinery.

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, you want to give us some
               vision?

                              MELKONIS
               Feast your eyes.

     Melkonis reaches to his console and presses a bank of switches.  The
     strip of viewscreens flickers into life.

     On each screen, we see BLACKNESS SPECKLED WITH STARS.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (after a pause)
               Where's Irth?

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, scan the whole sky.

     Melkonis hits buttons.  On the screens the images all begin to pan.

     CAMERA MOVES IN ON ONE OF THE SCREENS, with its moving image of a
     starfield.

     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE

     CLOSE SHOT OF A PANNING TV CAMERA.  This camera is remote controlled,
     turning silently on its base.

     CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK, revealing that the TV camera is mounted on
     the HULL OF SOME KIND OF CRAFT.

     When the pullback is finished, WE SEE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE STARSHIP
     ""SNARK,"" hanging in the depths of interstellar space, against a
     background of glimmering stars.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              ROBY
               Where are we?

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, contact traffic control.

     Melkonis switches on his radio unit.

                              MELKONIS
               This is deep space commercial vessel
               SNARK, registration number E180246,
               calling Antarctica air traffic
               control.  Do you read me?  Over.

     There is only the HISS OF STATIC.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (staring at a screen)
               I don't recognize that constellation.

                              STANDARD
               Dell, plot our location.

     Broussard goes into action, punching buttons, lighting up all his
     instruments.

                              BROUSSARD
               I got it.  Oh boy.

                              STANDARD
               Where the hell are we?

                              BROUSSARD
               Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We
               haven't even reached the outer rim
               yet.

                              ROBY
               What the hell?

     Standard picks up a microphone.

                              STANDARD
               This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we
               are not home.  Our present location
               seems to be only halfway to Irth.
               Remain at your posts and stand by.
               That is all.

                              ROBY
               Chaz, I've got something here on my
               security alert.  A high priority from
               the computer... 

                              STANDARD
               Let's hear it.

                              ROBY
                    (punches buttons)
               Computer, you have signalled a
               priority three message.  What is the
               message?

                              COMPUTER
                    (a mechanical voice)
               I have interrupted the course of the
               voyage.

                              ROBY
               What?  Why?

                              COMPUTER
               I am programmed to do so if certain
               conditions arise.

                              STANDARD
               Computer, this is Captain Standard.
               What conditions are you talking
               about?

                              COMPUTER
               I have intercepted a transmission of
               unknown origin.

                              STANDARD
               A transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               A voice transmission.

                              MELKONIS
               Out here?

     The men exchange glances.

                              COMPUTER
               I have recorded the transmission.

                              STANDARD
               Play it for us, please.

     Over the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static... THEN A
     STRANGE, UNEARTHLY VOICE FILLS THE ROOM, SPEAKING AN ALIEN
     LANGUAGE.  The bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then falls
     silent.

     The men all stare at each other in amazement.

                              STANDARD
               Computer, what language was that?

                              COMPUTER
               Unknown.

                              ROBY
               Unknown!  What do you mean?

                              COMPUTER
               It is none of the 678 dialects
               spoken by technological man.

     There is a pause, then EVERYBODY STARTS TALKING AT THE SAME TIME.

                              STANDARD
                    (silencing them)
               Just hold it, hold it!
                    (glares around the room)
               Computer: have you attempted to
               analyze the transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               Yes.  There are two points of salient
               interest.  Number one: it is highly
               systematized, indicating intelligent
               origin.  Number two: certain sounds
               are inconsistent with the human
               palate.

                              ROBY
               Oh my God.

                              STANDARD
               Well, it's finally happened.

                              MELKONIS
               First contact... 

                              STANDARD
               Sandy, can you home in on that beam?

                              MELKONIS
               What's the frequency?

                              STANDARD
               Computer, what's the frequency of
               the transmission?

                              COMPUTER
               65330 dash 99.

     Melkonis punches buttons.

                              MELKONIS
               I've got it.  It's coming from
               ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds,
               declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.

                              STANDARD
               Dell -- show me that on a screen.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll give it to you on number four.

     Broussard punches buttons.  One of the viewscreens flickers, and a
     small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               That's it.  Let me straighten it out.

     He twists a knob, moving the image on the screen till the dot is in
     the center.

                              STANDARD
               Can you get it a little closer?

                              BROUSSARD
               That's what I'm going to do.

     He hits a button.  The screen flashes and a PLANET APPEARS.

                              BROUSSARD (CONT'D)
               Planetoid.  Diameter, 120 kilometers.

                              MELKONIS
               It's tiny!

                              STANDARD
               Any rotation?

                              BROUSSARD
               Yeah.  Two hours.

                              STANDARD
               Gravity?

                              BROUSSARD
               Point eight six.  We can walk on it.

     Standard rises.

                              STANDARD
               Martin, get the others up to the
               lounge.

     INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM

     The entire crew -- STANDARD, ROBY, BROUSSARD, MELKONIS, HUNTER, and
     FAUST -- are all seated around a table, with Standard at the head.

                              MELKONIS
               If it's an S.O.S., we're morally
               obligated to investigate.

                              BROUSSARD
               Right.

                              HUNTER
               I don't know.  Seems to me we came on
               this trip to make some credit, not
               to go off on some kind of side trip.

                              BROUSSARD
                    (excited)
               Forget the credit; what we have here
               is a chance to be the first men to
               contact a nonhuman intelligence.

                              ROBY
               If there is some kind of alien
               intelligence down on that planetoid,
               it'd be a serious mistake for us to
               blunder in unequipped.

                              BROUSSARD
               Hell, we're equipped --

                              ROBY
               Hell, no!  We don't know what's down
               there on that piece of rock!  It
               might be dangerous!  What we should
               do is get on the radio to the
               exploration authorities... and let
               them deal with it.

                              STANDARD
               Except it will take 75 years to get
               a reply back.  Don't forget how far
               we are from the Colonies, Martin.

                              BROUSSARD
               There are no commercial lanes out
               here.  Face it, we're out of range.

                              MELKONIS
               Men have waited centuries to contact
               another form of intelligent life in
               the universe.  This is an opportunity
               which may never come again.

                              ROBY
               Look --

                              STANDARD
               You're overruled, Martin.  Gentlemen
               -- let's go.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The men are strapping in, but this time it is with grim determination.

                              STANDARD
               Dell, I want greater magnification.
               More surface detail.  I want to see
               what this place looks like.

                              BROUSSARD
               I'll see what I can do.

     He jabs his controls.  The image on the screen ZOOMS DOWN TOWARD THE
     PLANET; but all detail quickly vanishes into a featureless grey haze.

                              STANDARD
               It's out of focus.

                              ROBY
               No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud
               layer.

                              MELKONIS
               My God, it's stormy for a piece of
               rock that size!

                              ROBY
               Just a second.
                    (punches buttons)
               Those aren't water vapor clouds;
               they have no moisture content.

                              STANDARD
               Put ship in atmospheric mode.

     EXTERIOR - ""SNARK"" - OUTER SPACE

     The great dish antenna on the SNARK folds down against the main body
     of the ship, and other parts flatten out, until the ship has assumed
     an aerodynamic form.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               Dell, set a course and bring us in
               on that beam.

     EXTERIOR - SPACE

     The SNARK's engines cough into life, and send it drifting toward the
     distant dot that is the planetoid.

     CAMERA APPROACHES THE PLANETOID, until it looms large on screen.  It is
     turbulent, completely enveloped in dun-colored clouds.

     The SNARK drops down toward the surface.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              STANDARD
               Activate lifter quads.

                              BROUSSARD
               Activated.  Vertical drop checked.
               Correcting course.  On tangential
               course now, orbiting.
                    (brief pause as he
                     studies his instruments)
               Crossing the terminator.  Entering
               night side.

     EXTERIOR - ""SNARK"" - IN ORBIT

     Beneath the orbiting SNARK, night's curtain rolls across the planet.

     Descending at an angle, the SNARK drops down into the thick atmosphere
     of the planetoid.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              ROBY
               Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.

                              STANDARD
               Turn on navigation lights.

     EXTERIOR - ""SNARK""

     Hydroplaning down through the pea-soup atmosphere, a set of brilliant
     lights switches on, cutting through the dust, but hardly improving
     visibility.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              BROUSSARD
               Approaching point of origin.  Closing
               at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing.
               Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are
               directly above the source of the
               transmission.

                              STANDARD
               What's the terrain down there?

                              BROUSSARD
               Well, line of sight is impossible
               due to dust.  Radar gives me noise.
               Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared --
               noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There.
               Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.

                              STANDARD
               Is it solid?

                              BROUSSARD
               It's... basalt.  Rock.

                              STANDARD
               Then take her down.

                              BROUSSARD
               Drop begins... now!  Fifteen
               kilometers and dropping... twelve... 
               ten... eight and slowing.  Five.
               Three.  Two.  One kilometer and
               slowing.  Lock tractor beams.

     There is a LOUD ELECTRICAL HUM and the ship shudders.

                              ROBY
               Locked.

                              BROUSSARD
               Kill drive engines.

     The engines fall silent.

                              ROBY
               Engines off.

                              BROUSSARD
               Nine hundred meters and dropping.
               800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.

     EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT

     The night-shrouded surface is a hell of blowing dust.  The SNARK hovers
     above it on glowing beams of light, dropping down slowly.

     Landing struts unfold like insect legs.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

                              BROUSSARD
               And we're... down.

     EXTERIOR - SURFACE OF PLANET - NIGHT

     The ship touches down, heavily; it rocks on huge shock absorbers.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE

     The whole ship VIBRATES VIOLENTLY FOR AN INSTANT -- then all the
     panels in the room flash simultaneously and the LIGHT'S GO OUT.

                              BROUSSARD
               Jesus Christ!

     The lights come back on again.

                              STANDARD
               What the hell happened?

                              ROBY
                    (hits a switch)
               Engine room, what happened?

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Just a minute, hold it, I'm
               checking.

                              ROBY
               Has the hull been breached?

                              BROUSSARD
               Uh... 
                    (scans his gauges)
               No, I don't see anything.  We've
               still got pressure.

     There is a BEEP from the communicator.  Then:

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are
               clogged with dust.  We overheated and
               burned out a whole cell.

                              STANDARD
                    (strikes his panel)
               Damn it!  How long to fix?

                              ROBY
                    (into microphone)
               How long to fix?

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Hard to say.

                              ROBY
               Well, get started.

                              FAUST
                    (over, filtered)
               Right.  Talk to you.

                              STANDARD
               Let's take a look outside.  Turn the
               screens back on.

     Melkonis hits buttons.  The screens flicker, but remain black.

                              BROUSSARD
               Can't see a blessed thing.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     Only a few glittering lights distinguish the ship from the absolute
     darkness around it.

     THE WIND MOANS AND SCREAMS.  DUST BLOWS IN FRONT OF THE TINY GLIMMERING
     LIGHTS.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                              STANDARD
               Kick on the floods.

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT

     A ring of FLOODLIGHTS on the ship come to life, pouring blinding light
     out into the night.

     They illuminate nothing but a patch of featureless grey ground and
     clouds of blowing dust.  The wind shrieks.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

                              ROBY
               Not much help.

     Standard stares at the dark screens.

                              STANDARD
               Well, we can't go anywhere in this
               darkness.  How long till dawn?

                              MELKONIS
                    (consults his instruments)
               Well... this rock rotates every two
               hours.  The sun should be coming up
               in about 20 minutes.

                              BROUSSARD
               Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see
               something then.

                              ROBY
               Or something will be able to see us.

     They all look at him.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXTERIOR - SHIP - NIGHT (MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE)

     The floodlights on the SNARK fight a losing battle against the
     darkness and the storm.  MAIN THEME MUSIC BEGINS, EXTREMELY OMINOUS.

     THE TITLE APPEARS:

                              ALIEN

     RUN TITLES.

     Gradually, the screen begins to lighten as the SUN RISES.  The
     silhouette of the SNARK becomes visible, like some strange insect
     crouching motionless on the barren plain.  The floods shut off.  Dense
     clouds of impenetrable dust shriek and moan, obscuring everything and
     reducing the sunlight to a dull orange.

     END MAIN TITLES.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     CLOSE ON A SCREEN - it shows nothing but swirling clouds of orange
     dust.

     PULL BACK FROM SCREEN.  The men (Standard, Roby, Broussard, and
     Melkonis) are sitting and standing around the room, drinking coffee
     and staring at the screens, which reveal only the billowing dust.

                              ROBY
               There could be a whole city out
               there and we'd never see it.

                              BROUSSARD
               Not sitting on our butts in here,
               that's for sure.

                              STANDARD
               Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any
               response yet?

                              MELKONIS
                    (pulls off his earphones)
               Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn
               transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've
               tried every frequency on the
               spectrum.

                              BROUSSARD
               Are we just going to sit around and
               wait for an invitation?

     Roby gives Broussard a black look, then stabs a button on his console
     and speaks into the mike.

                              ROBY
                    (into mike)
               Hello, Faust!

                    (over, filtered)
               Yeah!

                              ROBY
               How's it coming on the engines?

     INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM

     Faust is seated at an electronic workbench, brightly lit, speaking
     into a wall intercom.

                              FAUST
               I never saw anything as fine as this
               dust... these cells are all pitted on
               a microscopic level.  I have to
               polish these things smooth again, so
               it's going to take a while.  Okay?

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

                              ROBY
               Yeah, okay.

                              STANDARD
               Sandy... how far are we from the
               source of the transmission?

                              MELKONIS
               Source of transmission is to the
               northeast... about 300 meters.

                              ROBY
               Close... 

                              BROUSSARD
               Close enough to walk to!

                              STANDARD
               Martin, would you run me an
               atmospheric?

               10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... 
               and some trace elements.

                              STANDARD
               Nontoxic... but unbreathable.
               Pressure?

               Ten to the fourth dynes per square
               centimeter.

                              STANDARD
               Good!  Moisture content?

                              ROBY
               Zero.  Dry as a bone.

                              STANDARD
               Any microorganisms?

                              ROBY
               Not a one.  It's dead.

                              STANDARD
               Anything else?

                              ROBY
               Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.

                              STANDARD
               Well, we won't need pressure suits,
               but breathing masks are called for.
               Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of
               portable unit that we can use to
               follow that transmission to its
               source?

                              MELKONIS
               No problem.

                              BROUSSARD
               I volunteer for the exploration
               party.

                              STANDARD
               I heard you.  You want to break out
               the side arms?

     INTERIOR - MAIN ARM LOCK - DAY

     Standard, Broussard and Melkonis enter the lock.  They all wear gloves,
     boots, jackets, and pistols.

     Broussard touches a button and the inner door slides silently shut,
     sealing them into the lock.

     They all pull on rubber full-head oxygen masks.

                              STANDARD
                    (adjusting the radio on his
                     mask)
               I'm sending.  Do you hear me?

                              BROUSSARD
               Receiving.

                              MELKONIS
               Receiving.

                              STANDARD
               All right.  Now just remember: keep
               away from those weapons unless I say
               otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

               Read you, Chaz.

     INTERIOR - MAIN AIR LOCK - DAY

                              STANDARD
               Open the outer door.

     Ponderously, the outer lock door slides open.  ORANGE SUNLIGHT streams
     into the lock, and clouds of dust swirl in.  We hear the MOANING OF THE
     WIND OUTSIDE.

     A mobile stairway slides out of the open hatchway, and clunks as it
     hits the ground.

     Standard walks out into the storm, followed by the others.

     EXTERIOR - PLANETOID - DAY

     The three men trot down the gangplank to the surface of the planet.
     Their feet sink into a thick layer of dust and loose rock.

     The men huddle together, looking around.  The wind screams and tugs at
     their clothes.  Nothing can be seen.

                              STANDARD
               Which way, Sandy?

     Melkonis is fiddling with a portable direction-finder.

                              MELKONIS
                    (pointing)
               That way.

                              STANDARD
               You lead.

     Melkonis walks into the blinding dust clouds, followed closely by the
     others.

                              STANDARD
               Okay, Martin.  We're on our way.

     INTERIOR - BRIDGE - DAY

     Roby is the sole occupant of the bridge.  He is huddled over his
     console, smoking a cigarette and watching three moving blips on a
     screen.

                              ROBY
               Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you
               on my board.

ALIEN III


THE SCREEN IS BLACK

A pinpoint of light appears.
Red.  An ember. 
Unseen BELLOWS blow.

GLASS FURNACE

The embers glow.  Flame.
The fire GROWS.

A RIVER OF MOLTEN GLASS

Heated by the furnace to over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit. 
White Hot.

GLASS FACTORY

Flickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls.  
Coarsely grained wood.  Moisture blasted out by years of
intense heat.  Timbers split.  Patched with new wood,
it too now old and dry.

SMOKE

Billows up the walls.
Hangs as an angry, black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of
the vaulted ceiling.  Almost obscures --

A MAN

On a narrow LEDGE, twenty feet about the Glassworks' floor. 
His clothing is Medieval.  A rough textured cassock. 
He is a MONK.

LOUVERS are set into the wall.  He angles them open.
The smoke begins to escape.

The Monk turns, raises arms and LEAPS from his lofty perch --
Gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a FLOWING FOX --
a primitive hand-held pulley that runs down a rope.
He lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by --

MORE MONKS

By their dress.  With Blowing Iron and Pontil.
They blow and shape the molten glass.  Crack off the finished
pieces.  The old way.

ONE PARTICULAR MONK

Black skinned, early fifties.
Stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but
he is watching something else.  It moves him to song.
Lilting tenor lifts high into the air.
This is BROTHER KYLE.

			BROTHER KYLE
	Well would he guess the ascending of the star,
	Wherein his patient's fortunes settled were.
	He knew the course of every malady,
	Were it of cold or heat or moist or dry.
	Brother John, would-be Doctour of Physick.

We see the object of his song:

BROTHER JOHN

Not yet forty.  Strong features, but fear behind the eyes.
The fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence.
A good face, nonetheless.
He stirs a thick mixture in a mortar.
Next to him another MONK sits holding his arm out in front of
him, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious BURN.

		       BROTHER KYLE
		Tend you quickly he will,
		with bottles from a shelf.
		But heals not, so easily,
		The ills which plague himself.

Brother John stops stirring.

		      BROTHER JOHN
		   (to Kyle)
		Enough.

He scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the
Burned Monk's arm.  The Burned Monk INHALES sharpley as the cool
mixture contacts the injured area.  

		     BROTHER JOHN
		  (to the burned Monk)
		Relax.
		  (to Kyle)
		Put those lungs of yours to better
		use.

		     BROTHER KYLE
		Yes, Doc Tor.

Kyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass --
a BLOB of white hot glass hanging on the end.

He rolls the blob on the Marver, a flat, polished piece of 
iron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container. 

John wraps a fray-edged cloth bandage around the burn.

			     JOHN
		Keep this from getting wet.  Go home at
		late afternoon mealtime and don't come
		back to work today --

		     BURNED MONK
		But John --

			     JOHN
		I'll tell the Abbot.  Just rest today.
		You're lucky you only burned yourself on
		the side of the furnace.  If some of that
		glass had gotten on your arm --

He points to the top of his forearm.

	   	            JOHN
		-- it would've burned clean through to
		the other side.

He mimes a drop down from the bottom of his arm.
The Burned Monk shudders at the thought.  

BELLS toll.
 
		            JOHN
		That's late afternoon.  Now get on.

			BURNED MONK
		Thank you, John.  I --

			   JOHN
		You're welcome.  Go!

The Burned Monk trundles off, injured arm against his chest.
John gathers his mortar, pestle, and extra bandages into a
burlap sack.  Kyle comes over.

			  KYLE
		Good work.

			  JOHN
		All right, but I'm no Father Anselm.

  			  KYLE
		You're yourself, that's better...

Kyle pushes him through the door...

INTO THE HALLWAY

The Hallway is alive with cassocked monks.
Their LOW CHANTING reverberates throughout the building.
The wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights.
This is obviously a MEDIEVAL MONASTERY...

			KYLE
		The Abbot will be pleased.

			JOHN
		Don't.

			KYLE
		Don't what?

			JOHN
		Please don't tell him.  At least until
		I know if there's an infection.

			KYLE
		You want to be the Abbey's Physician,
		and you haven't learned the first rule:
		Don't worry about the patient.

John's face drops.

			KYLE
		I shouldn't have. Sorry.  Look, I know
		how you must --

			JOHN
		You don't, but thanks anyway.

AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY

A wide stairwell.  A constant stream of monks all moving down
the stairs.  Coming from floors above.  Headed for lunch.
Kyle starts down.  John starts up --

			KYLE
		Not coming down?

			JOHN
		I have someone waiting for me.

Kyle disappears into the crowd.
John moves up...

THE STAIRWAY

A river of brown cassocks running downstream.
John is the only one moving against the flow.
He exits the stairwell --

ONE FLOOR UP

A narrow corridor lined with doorways.
John moves to one in particular.
He doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob.
This is his room.
He opens the door --

IN BROTHER JOHN'S ROOM

An old, worn out DOG lays in wait on an old, worn out cassock
which is now serving as its bed.
At the sight of John it stands.

			JOHN
		Come on, Mattias.

The dog, MATTIAS, joins him in the hall.
Monk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs. 
Past another dozen or so Monks who are on their way down.

INT. LIBRARY

A vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches
between aisle after aisle of floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves
jammed to capacity with BOOKS of all shapes and sizes.  Millions
of books, from the looks of it.
From each book hangs a long CHAIN, long enough to allow the 
book to be carried only as far as the nearest table.

A CORPULENT MONK - BROTHER PHILIP

In his fifties, and the Librarian by his stern affect, his
position behind a broad, but also old oak desk, and the large
KEY hanging from his belt.  He watches the few stragglers return
their chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door,
then rises and joins them...

IN THE CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY

John leans against the wall as Philip exits.
Mattias is nowhere to be seen. 

			PHILIP
		Brother John.

			JOHN
		Brother Philip.

			PHILIP
		Feeding the mind instead of the body
		again?

			JOHN
		My training has taught me to feed what's
		hungry.

Philip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway.

			PHILIP
		As did mine.  As long as you're alone.
		Enjoy yourself -- and remember, no book
		leaves the library.

			JOHN
		How could I forget?  Have a good meal...

John watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs.
When he's gone from sight John lifts the bottom of his cassock
to reveal Mattias.

			JOHN
		Perfect.

They move into the library...

THE MEDIEVAL SECTION

The oldest books.
John moves to the stacks.
Mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits.
This is his regular place.

AT THE SHELVES

John stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient Tome.
He runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding.
A smile plays across his lips.

He carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so
there is slack in the chain.
Sits on the bench next to the dog.
Clears his throat, opens the book, begins to read...

			John
	    	    (reading)
		In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
		Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
		the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks --

			VOICE O/S
		Sometimes, I think you'd like that.

John turns to find --

THE ABBOT

Leader of the monastery.  In his seventies but looks younger.
His Cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden
CHAIN in place of a rope belt.  He crosses to the table.

John closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect.

			John
		Abbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would --

			ABBOT
		Mind?  Just Philip, if he knew.  I passed
		him on the way up.  He said you'd come 
		in alone.  I knew better.

He scratches the back of Mattias' neck.

			ABBOT
		Hello, Mattias.  How are you, boy?

The dog snuffles in response.

			ABBOT
		You know what Philip says about Mattias'
		hair and his breathing.  You'll have to 
		take him out of here.

			JOHN
		He likes when I read to him and -- I 
		can't --

John looks down sheepishly.  Though nearly forty, he feels
almost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot.  
The Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.

			ABBOT
		    (smiles)
		Someone must have left this one unlocked.
		Take the book with you.

He hands the key to John, who is shocked --
this is a great honor.

			JOHN
		Father, I --?

			ABBOT
		Kyle tells me you did a good job at
		the glassworks today.

			JOHN
		I'll reserve judgement until the patient
		lives.

John crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book.
He returns the key.

			ABBOT
		It will get easier.  Father Anselm was...
		an unexpected loss.  You'll do fine.

The Abbot walks towards the door...

			ABBOT
		Just have it back before the end of lunch.
		Oh -- And I didn't see you in here.

			JOHN
		Thank you.
		      (to Mattias)
		Let's go upstairs, boy.

John takes his book -- Moves to a spiral wooden staircase.
Mattias at his heels.
Goes UP --

INTO THE BELL TOWER

The mechanics of the bell tower -- all ropes and wooden cogs
cast scary shadows.
A doorway leads to --

THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Thick with sandy dust.  The wood shows through thin patches.  
We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what we think is the roof of the Abbey
is actually --

THE SURFACE OF ARCEON - NIGHT

The door has opened onto the SURFACE OF A PLANTOID!
The curving horizon broken only by the very top of the
Abbey bell tower poking through from the levels below.  
SMOKE curls from vents set into the surface.
Sunken areas of the planet's sirface are SEAS.

This is ARCEON.
An manmade orbiter.
A shell of lightweight foamed steel, five miles in diameter.
Constructed by The Company on Special Order with habitable
level within finished in whatever material suits its end user.

This orbiter, for reasons to be discovered later, has been
sheathed in wood.

JOHN

Walks to the shore of an inland SEA.
Sits on a bare patch of wood.  Looks up.
His eyes grow accustomed to --

THE NIGHT SKY - JOHN POV

Freckled with tiny dots of light.
Stars.  Spread across the inky void.
Bathe Arceon's surface with their celestial glow.

John smiles at Mattias, breathes deep. 
The atmosphere up here is thinner, but fresher. 
He opens the book.
Reads aloud --

			JOHN
		In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother
		Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury
		the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day
		by day, one by one, until I am the only 
		one left.  I stayed as long as I could bear 
		it, then with my dog -- 

Mattias lifts his ears at this part.  His favorite part.

			JOHN
		- fled.  I have put this to parchment lest
		this pestilence - this Black Death - 
		stay my hand.
			(beat)
		This was finished by another hand...

John closes the book.  Something catches his eye --
Something among the myriad points of light in the sky.
Millions of miles away:

ONE OF THE STARS

Brighter than the rest.  MOVING.
Fast enough to leave a faint trail.
Across the stars.  And down...
A comet.

John stands.  Watches --

THE STAR

Growing brighter.
Drawing nearer.

JOHN

Joined by three other MONKS.
They are older than he.
The Four men watch the sky...

THE STAR

Brighter still.  Closer.

MORE MONKS

Two dozen.  A hundred.
They come up through the planet's surface.
Out of wooden trap doors.  Join the others.
Days pass.
Now three hundred.
Necks bowed back.
Mouths agape.
A SUBTITLE identifies...

			RELIGIOUS COLONY ARCEON
			-----------------------
			POPULATION: 350 Exiles
			CRIME:  Political Heresy

THE STAR

Fills the sky.
Burns brighter still as it hits the planetoid's atmosphere.

ON THE SURFACE OF ARCEON

Hundreds of Monks shield their eyes as the ship -- the star --
ROARS over their heads.  Trailing FIRE --

John holds up his hands - to touch a star --
Skin BLISTERS as it passes over him,
He turns and watches as it --
Arcs downward --

INTO THE SEA

WHOMP- SSSSSSSSSS --!!
PLUMES of steam rise into the air.
The water boils.  Fish bob to the surface.  Bloated.  Dead.

JOHN

Is the first to hit the shore.
Small leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake.
His coracle is the first into the water.
The others running up behind him.
He cannot hear the SHOUTS of warning.

ON THE SEA - DAWN

The sun cracks over the black water.
John's hands move the rough wooden oars.
Blistered palm opens.
BLOOD flows.
He tears off a piece of his cassock --
Rips it with his teeth --
Wraps the bloody hand.
Rows.

THE STAR

Ship.  Star Ship.
Sulaco escape vehicle #4 rocks on the water.
White metal skin blackened by the heat.

JOHN

Rows right into it.
His coracle pitches in the choppy surf.  
He scrambles onto the ship's cracked tile surface.
Teeters -- balances -- moves to the unmistakeable HATCH.
Looks around for a knob, a handle --

NEXT TO THE HATCH

A small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote
urgency.  John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny
metal LEVER.  He stares at it...a beat.
Then quickly pulls it down...
WUORRRSH -!
Hull door OPENS.

The doorway is a black maw.
John crosses himself.
Begins to lower his foot into the hatch --

			KYLE O/S
		Watch it!

He almost falls backwards off the ship.  Looks back --

THE OTHER MONKS

Are rapidly approaching.
Kyle gestulates wildly --

			KYLE
		John!  Wait -- !  Don't go in!

John turns back to the open hatch.
Machine recirculated air flows out.
He feels it on the skin of his face.  Cool.
Cool, and artificial.  It calls to him.
He steps in.  Swallowed by the blackness --

WHOOSH-CLANG -!
The door closes behind him.

INT. SULACO ESCAPE POD #4 - DAY

Dark.  Dim red lights.  John stands still as his eyes adjust to
the darkness.  He sees:

NEWT'S HYPER SLEEP TUBE

A glass and metal COFFIN -- pneumatic piping twines around its
base.  The glass lid is BROKEN.  A Small RED LIGHT pulses at the
head of the tube -- a soft VOICE and TONE, like your seat belt
warning -- is audible...

			COMPUTER VOICE
			(sotto)
		Seal broken...seal broken...

John finds himself moving towards the tube...
Looks through the broken lid:

IN THE TUBE

There is a splattered BLOOD STAIN on the sterile white
interior.  OLD, turned rust-brown.
Whatever happened here happened a while ago.
Rust colored drips trail down to --

THE FLOOR

Drag marks.  His eyes follow the stains to a pile of
Bloody clothing against a control panel.  A jumpsuit.  Torn.
Child size.  The head of child's DOLL, but no body to be found.

JOHN

Looks back towards the door.
Part of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights
back his fear.  He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone
in here may need his help.  He presses forward -- 
Averts his gaze from the clothing, UP to the blinking and
glowing instrument panels and their myraid -- 

LIGHTS

Pressure lights.  Data lights.  Warning lights.
Thousands of lights.  Like the stars in the sky.

It's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and
never this close up.  He steps further into the ship, his fear
now replaced by fascination, follows the lights....

ON A PALE GREEN SCREEN

LED numbers race -- 7,291.01.05...06...07
A legand identifies ""Elapsed since separation.""
He moves on...

A VIDEO MONITOR

Through scanning bars of snow, an image:
A WOMAN with a YOUNG GIRL standing in front of her.
The Woman's arms are wrapped around the girl.
Protective. Maternal.

The Woman speaks.  Her message repeats itself.
A tape loop, although John has no idea what that is.

			WOMAN
		...taking pod four.  The Crew of the SS
		Sulaco and all Marine commandoes are dead.
		Ship's sensors have interrupted the hyper
		sleep cycle.  An overlooked alien egg has
		hatched.  Bishop and Hicks have been killed.
		Xenomorphs have infested the cruiser.  Newt 
		and I are taking pod four.  The Crew of...

The WARNING TONE of the Woman's message rekindles John's fear.
He moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship,
following the trail of blinking instruments --
Drawn to touch a button.  Click...

SOMETHING TENTACLE-LIKE DROPS DOWN ON HIS SHOULDER!
Just an oxygen mask.

John feels his rapidly BEATING heart as he pushes aside the
plastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle. 
His hand brushes over a SENSOR which responds by lighting and --

HSSSSSSSSS -!
A BLAST of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe --
John SHOUTS and back up into --

ANOTHER HYPER SLEEP TUBE!!!

Next to Newt's now empty tube.
Humming gently.  Still operational.
John approaches it cautiously.
He can make out the occupant through the lid...

A WOMAN

The woman from the screen.  This is RIPLEY.
In hypersleep.  Wearing a white cotton tank top and boxer-type
shorts.  Christ, she looks beautiful.  

John looks from Ripley to her image on the monitor, then back.
Sinks to his knees, reverent.  Fascination has replaced fear
again.  Moves his face closer to the lid.  
Closer to hers...

DAYLIGHT spills in --
John's head WHIPS towards the source of the light --

THE DOOR

Open.  Kyle and the other monks.

			KYLE
		John - what is it?  Is this a Supply ship?

			JOHN
		No.  No supplies.  Kyle, there's someone
		in here --

The Second Monk looks at Kyle.

			SECOND MONK
		This is forbidden.

			KYLE
		John.  Just get the hell out of there --

			JOHN
		I don't want to stay.  I have to get her
		out before this sinks.  You come in, give
		me a hand --

			KYLE
		Her?  Look, this is not the supply ship,
		so this is technology forbidden to us.
		Get out of there now!

John looks down at Ripely.
A KEYPAD is mounted at the head of the tube.
A red button:  ""EMERG-OPEN""
That's plain enough.

			JOHN
		All right --

He presses it.
The Tube opens with a loud BLAST of compressed air.
The Monks at the door recoil at the sound.

						CUT TO:

EXT. SPACE SHIP - ON THE SEA - DAY

Ripley has been lowered into a large coracle.  John holds her in
front of him.  Unconscious.  
Her head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves. 
The monks start to row back to short.

			FIRST MONK
		     (reverent)
		A space ship...

			SECOND MONK
                    (even more reverent)
		A woman...

			KYLE
		You shouldn't have gone in --

			JOHN
		I'm supposed to be a doctor.

He pushes Ripley's hair away from her forehead.

			JOHN
		She could've been lost.

			FIRST MONK
		Been a long time since I saw either.

			SECOND MONK
		It isn't sinking.  Look at it.  What are we
		supposed to do with it?

			KYLE
		What was it like in there --?

			JOHN
		Lights.  So many lights --

			THIRD MONK
		Tow it in.  Bring it in.

			SECOND MONK
		It's evil.

			FIRST MONK
		It's just technology.

			SECOND MONK
		Evil technology.  Look at these fish --

			THIRD MONK
		The Abbot will know what we should do
		with it --

			KYLE
		Just lights?

			JOHN
		Machines.  Buttons.  Metal.

			SECOND MONK
		See?  Just look at the fish.

			THIRD MONK
		The Abbot will know.

			SECOND MONK
		They're boiled.  These fish are boiled. 

			JOHN
		Thousands of lights.  Like the stars.
		Like Heaven on Earth.

Ripley stirs in John's arms.  Groans.
Fights to come out of her fugue state...
Looks around through half-lidded eyes --
She is surrounded by rowing, cassocked Monks.
MONKS?  She closes her eyes.
Tries to clear the imagine.  Opens:
They're still there.
She looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist --
realizes she's sitting on someone's lap.
Looks back over her shoulder --

JOHN

He smiles at her.
Friendly, not sexual.

RIPLEY

Shakes her head.  Tries to speak --
Her lips form soundless words.
She looks over her other shoulder, sees --

THE SHIP - RIPLEY POV

Bobbing on the surface.  
Growing small with each stroke of the oars.

RIPLEY

Brows knit.  Fights the cobwebs in her brain.
Tries to focus on the ship --
Remembers. 
Turns to John, tries to speak --

			RIPLEY
		Wait.  New...

She loses consciousness.  

						GO TO BLACK...

INT. THE ABBEY - RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

Streaks of light move across the darkness.
Form patterns of light and shadow against the wooden walls.
There is a sublime stillness, but coming through the walls are
the muted, far off SOUNDS of the Abbey --
The SAWING of wood.  HAMMERING.
WHISPERED prayers.
LILTING song.

We move down off the wall to a hand-made wooden bed.
Ripley in restless sleep.

EXT. ARCEON SEA - DUSK

The waters grown rough with the approach of night.  Wind whips across
white wave tops -- SPRAYS the dozen Monks who LASH their 
boats to Ripley's SHIP with thick hemp ropes --
Start to tow it to shore...

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Ripley is sleeping -- but struggling against some unseen foe --
She tries to sit up -- can't.  Tries to shake off the effects of
the suspended animation...looks up through half-lidded eyes:

JOHN

Sits next to her.  Quite asleep.
Hands swathed in white bandages.  Book resting on his lap.

She squints to make the figure standing in the shadows
behind him -- it's skin picks up and reflects tiny points of
flickering cangle light - seems to ripple as it moves --

THE ALIEN

Big, black shiny-smooth head moves into the taper light.
It moves towards her, cable-like arms held out at its side --
moving out of sync with its feet -- Ripley tries to move - 
to cry out -- She can't.

She can only move her eyes.  She looks over at John, sleeping
peacefully.  He doesn't notice the Alien --

The Alien moves closer.  
She can feel his breath -- it evaporates the sweat  on her
forehead -- a CHILL runs through her but she still can't move --

The Alien stands alongside her bed.
Extends a six-fingered hand...
Gently rests it on her stomach.
Cocks its head -- like it's listening to something.
The implication is clear.

Ripley finds her voice --

			RIPLEY
		AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!

Her eyes open wide --
She sits bolt upright.

A hand moves to her forehead.  Gently pushes her head back to
the pillow.  John's.

			JOHN
		You're out of it.  Out of it...

Ripley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared.
John sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder:
Nothing.
Ripley's eyes roll back into her head.
She tries to speak -- It was there.
Her hand, at her side, tightens into a fist --

John's hand covers hers.
Eases the fingers open again.
She feels the coarse bandages against her palm.

He starts to read quietly from Saint Augustines' Confessions.
She begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her
like waves lapping against the shore...

EXT. SURGACE OF ARCEON - DAY

A HOWLING DUST STORM has kicked up.  The monks wear small round
goggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a 
huge BLOCK AND TACKLE arrangement --

Hundreds of ropes grow TAUT.
Timbers GROAN.
They LIFT Ripley's SHIP -- SWING it over to a large portal --

INT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

Ripley lays with eyes closed.
Muffled VOICES outside her door:

			ABBOT
		How is the woman, John?

			JOHN
		I don't think she's here yet.

At the sound of John's voice the SLIGHTEST smile plays 
across Ripley's sleeping lips.

			JOHN
		She is close, though.

As they continue talking, Ripley wakes.  Opens her eyes.
Rolls over onto her side --
There is a window right next to the bed.
Ripley lifts herself up on one elbow, looks out:

HER POV

Garden of Earthly delights...
Monks laboring under a beautiful, celestial blue sky --
picking apples, fishing on the water on small inland lakes.
Working with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages.  Lyrical.
It makes her feel good.  She scans the countryside...

Sheep graze around wooden ladders stretching hundreds of feet
up to the -- Ripley does a take --

WORKERS ON A SCAFFOLDING

With crude brushes at the end of poles -- PAINT the sky blue.
The Abbey, the cottages, the fields outside her window are all
on one level - INSIDE THE PLANET.

The vaulted CEILING, painted to look like the sky with huge
glass ""windows"" to allow the sunlight in, is actually the
UNDERSIDE of the planetoid's outer shell.

Ripley looks back at the Monks on the ground:
Instead of repairing, they are taking the cabins apart, stacking
the wood onto push carts --

			RIPLEY
		What the hell --?

SUDDENLY --
The Sulaco Escape ship APPEARS in front of her.
SWINGS past her window suspended by ropes.
Then disappears up, out of sight.
Ripley checks her pulse.

			RIPLEY
		This must be a dream.  A bad one.

She rolls back onto the bed.
Stares up at the ceiling.

ABOVE HER - ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY

Monks scurry around the Ship as it is lowered into place on
a flat area of the roof above the libaray.
It seats with a deeply resounding THUD...

RIPLEY

Hears the SOUND and then another - her door OPENING.
She turns to find the Abbot and John standing in the doorway.
John waits in the doorway as the Abbot crosses to the chair by
the bed and sits.

			RIPLEY
		Who are you?

			ABBOT
		I am the Abbot.  Leader of this Colony.
		And you?

He smiles.  Open.  Friendly.

			RIPLEY
		Ripley.  How did I get here?

			ABBOT
		Your vehicle crash landed.
		     (indicates John)
		Brother John found you and brought
		you here.

			RIPLEY
		Where is here?

			ABBOT
		This is the Minorite Abbey within the
		manmade orbiter Arceon.

			RIPLEY
		Can I use a radio to --
	
			ABBOT
		We have no radio here.  We are a monastic
		order that has renounced all modern
		technology.  We live the old way.  The pure
		way.

She shakes her head.

			RIPLEY
		Uh, I - I still don't feel 100%.  Whoever
		took me out of the stasis tube must not 
		have run the full D-F program...
		Where's Newt?

The Abbot looks at her blankly.

			RIPLEY
		There was a little girl with me --

			ABBOT
		You were alone.

			RIPLEY
		No.  She was with me.  I put her in her
		stasis tube -- We launched when the --

			ABBOT
		You were the only living thing found
		aboard that vessel.

The Abbot watches Ripley as the terrible truth overcomes her --

			RIPLEY
		     (slowly)
		Oh, God.  Newt.

She stops -- gets that chill up her spine --
She realizes that she MUST have brought the Alien with her.

			RIPLEY	
		It came with us.

The Abbot leans in.

			ABBOT
		What came with you?

			RIPLEY
		Listen -- there is a danger here.  It
		came with me.  How long have I been here?

			ABBOT
		Almost two days --

			RIPLEY
		     (calculates)
		Loose for two days.  This planet could be
		overrun within the week.

Ripley grabs the Abbot by his cassock --

			RIPLEY
		Look, there's a xenomorph --
		    (sees his confusion)
		An Alien creature.  A killer.  A monster.
		And now it's here.

The Abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner
of Santa Monica and 3rd who's babbling about Judgement Day.  The
guy with his pants down around his kness.

She sees this, releases her hold on him...
	
			RIPLEY
		Calm down, Ripley.  Okay, I was with a
		platoon of Colonial Marines on a mission
		to planetoid LV426.  We left Earth six
		months ago - maybe a year --

			ABBOT
		     (interrupts)
		Wait a moment --

The Abbot becomes aware of John's presence in the doorway.
Turns over his shoulder at him.

			ABBOT
		Leave us.

John waits there a beat, then backs out and closes the door.

			ABBOT
		Continue.

			RIPLEY
		We launched in the Cruiser Sulaco from 
		Gateway sub-orbital space station --

			ABBOT
		Not possible.

			RIPLEY
		What do you mean?

			ABBOT
		When we left Earth seventy years ago, it
		was on the brink of a New Dark Age.
		Technology was on the verge of destroying
		the planet's environment.  A computer virus
		was threatening to wipe away all recorded
		knowledge.  There didn't seem to be any
		way it could be averted.  In the almost
		forty years since we were towed out here
		in hypersleep, the news that came with 
		occasional supply ships only got worse.
		Finally, the ships stopped coming.  We 
		had to resign ourselves to the fact that
		worst had come to pass, and the Earth
		no longer existed.

Now she gives him that look.
	
			RIPLEY
		    (slowly)
		Uh...All right... Forget the Earth - How
		many people do you have here?  Let's worry
		about them.  Warn them --

A new look overtakes the Abbot's face.  A look of fear.  
Now she's getting to him - or is she?
He abruptly stands. 

			ABBOT
		Your mind is troubled.  You need to rest
		some more.

			RIPLEY
		I don't need rest - I need to get to 
		your people.  You've got to get to them --
		tell them about the alien --

He heads for the door --

			ABBOT
		I have had enough for now.

			RIPLEY
		Enough?  Didn't you hear what I said?
		It could wipe out the entire population
		of this planet.  It may have started 
		already - Have there been any unusual 
		deaths since I got here?

The Abbot stops in the door -

			ABBOT
		No.  And there won't be.

The Abbot SLAMS the door behind him.

THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY

John stands nearby as the Abbot addresses two BURLY MONKS

			ABBOT
		Bolt it.

The guards move to bolt the door.

			JOHN
		What is it -- What's wrong?

			ABBOT
		Your patient is in a dangerous mental
		state.  Nobody gets in or out until I
		say so.

			JOHN
		But I.  Her meals --

			ABBOT
		Nobody.

			JOHN
		Father, I don't understand --

The Abbot turns and disappears down the hall.
John looks from the departing Abbot to the two Guard/Monks.


THE LIBRARY - NIGHT

John has his head buried in his hands.  His back rises and falls
with the rhythmic breathing of sleep.
Mattias curled up on his feet.  Asleep as well.
WHAM!
The Library door FLIES open --!
John sits bolt upright -- 

A HYSTERICAL MONK bursts in.
Rushes to John's table.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Brother John!  You're here!  The Abbot
		said you'd -- I need -- you're the
		medic --

			JOHN
		What?!

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		My Sandy -- she's ill --

John tries to rub the fitfull sleep out of his eyes.

			JOHN
		Huh?  A woman?

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Sandy.  My ewe.

John returns his head to the table.

			JOHN
		One of your sheep?  Jesus Christ.
		Call a vet.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Father Anselm was the vet.

John looks under his arms at Mattias --
The dog just stares at him.

			JOHN
		You're no help.  Okay, let me get my bag.
		All creatures great and small...

INT. HYSTERICAL MONK'S BARN - NIGHT

A small structure housing a handful of sheep and a few chickens
in wire cages.  The wooden walss are full of gaps where boards
have been ripped off.

The Hysterical Monk holds a torch to illuminate the scene.  One of
his sheep is laying on its side...

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		I just gave her dinner and she
		keeled over.

			JOHN
		So would I.  It's freezing in here.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		Been using the wood from the walls
		for the fire in my cabin.

			JOHN
		Haven't we all...

John kneels at the ewe.

She's breathing heavy.  Rapidly.

John puts his left hand down on the hay covered floor while he
checks the animal's neck pulse with his right hand.  
She gives a weak ""Baa-ah.""

			JOHN
		May be pneumonia.  Pitch some of that hay
		around her.  Stop this damn cold breeze.

The Hysterical Monk props the torch up in an empty bucket and
retreives a crude iron pitchfork from the wall.
Starts to pile hay around the fallen animal.

			JOHN
		First, I'll --

He sits up to reach for his back, then stops when he sees what's
on his left hand --

A SLIMY MUCOUS-LIKE SUBSTANCE

			JOHN
		Wait a minute...

The Hysterical Monk stops on mid-pitch.
John rubs the material between his fingers.
Brings it close to his nose.  Sniffs.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		What is it?

			JOHN
		I don't know.  It's all over the ground.
		Some sort of --

BAAA-AAAH!!!
The ewe starts to SHAKE - QUIVER --
John tries to hold it down --
The Hysterical Monk, at this juncture, goes completely apeshit.

			HYSTERICAL MONK
		What?!  WHAT?!

			JOHN
		Jesus!  Help m --

The ewe is shaking so violently that John is thrown back --
He knocks over the bucket -- the torch falls into the hay --
The light is cut off as the torch almost smothers.
Then the hay starts to burn --
Weak fire light revealing:

BAAaa-Aha-SCLORTCH-H-!!
THE EWE EXPLODES ---!

Stomach BURSTS --
SPRAYING the two Monks with entrails and blood --
They start SCREAMING.

The flickering FIRE LIGHT grows as...

A TERRIBLE ALIEN CHEST-BURSTER

BURSTS out of the jerking and twitching carcass.

It shows the characteristics of the animal in which it has
gestated.  Tiny razor sharp teeth and black, glass-like eyes
peer from a enlongated head covered with downy, but gore-matted
WOOL.  A quadroped, its shrunked hind legs struggling to free
itself from the cooling morass of intestines.

John can only SCREAM as the most horrible nightmare he can
imagine tr"

EXT. BARTON HOME - DAY

CLOSE ON: A HOUSE-ARREST ANKLE BRACELET.

                    CLINT BARTON (O.S.)
          Okay, you see where you're going?
          Let's work on how to get there.

Pan up to find...CLINT BARTON, with his daughter, LILA,
coaching her as she notches an arrow in her bow.

                    CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
          Okay, good...tip down...bow arm
          out...three fingers-

                       LILA BARTON
          Why three?

                    CLINT BARTON
          `Cause two's not enough and four's
          too much-

                    LAURA BARTON (O.S.)
          You guys want mustard or mayo, or
          both?

CLINT TURNS. IN THE FIELD BEHIND THEM, his wife, LAURA
BARTON sets up a picnic as COOPER and NATHANIEL play soccer.

                    LILA BARTON
          Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

                     CLINT BARTON
          We'll both have mustard, hon!
              (to Lila)
          Okay. Draw back, deep breath...

She lets loose.   THUD!   HER ARROW HITS NEAR THE BULLS-EYE.

                    CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
          Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your
          arrow.

                    LAURA BARTON (O.S.)
          Enough murder practice! Soup's on!

                    CLINT BARTON
          One sec, babe. Be right there!
          We're gonna kill some hot dogs.
          We're hungry.

But when he turns back...LILA IS GONE.   The bow and arrow lie
at his feet. He stares.
                                                               2


                         CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
             Lila?    Babe, did you see Lila-

He turns to his wife, BUT SHE'S GONE. So are the boys.        The
soccer ball rolls to a stop near the picnic blanket.

NO ONE CAN BE SEEN FOR A HUNDRED YARDS IN ALL DIRECTIONS.

                         CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
             Guys?    Guys, come on...

Clint walks toward the field, dread growing.

                         CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
             Laura?

Clint breaks into a panicked run.

                         CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
             LAURA!

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

BLACKNESS.

TITLE: ""TWENTY-TWO DAYS LATER.""

Soon, THE BENATAR tumbles past, adrift...


INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - NIGHT

TONY STARK and NEBULA play table-top football.     She wins.

                        TONY
                 (offering his hand)
             Good sport. Have fun?

Nebula studies his hand, confused.      Finally she shakes.

                       NEBULA
             It was fun.


INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

Tony, thin and haggard, kneels in front of HIS BROKEN IRON
MAN HELMET. He hits a switch. A light blinks.
                                                             3


TONY'S RECORDING: he stares directly into the ""camera.""

                    TONY
          This thing on? Hey, Ms. Potts.
          Pep. If you find this recording,
          don't post it on social media.
          It's going to be a real tearjerker.


EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

THE BENATAR sparks, adrift.

                    TONY (O.S.)
          I don't know if you're ever going
          to see these. I don't even know if
          you're still...God, I hope so.
          Today's day twenty-one, no...twenty-
          two.


INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK

NEBULA lasers shut Tony's infected wound.

                    TONY (O.S.)
          You know, if it wasn't for the
          existential terror of staring into
          the literal void of space, I'd say
          I'm feeling a little better today.
          Infection's run its course, thanks
          to the Blue Meanie back there.
          You'd like her. She's very
          practical. And only a tiny bit
          sadistic.


INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK

TONY AND NEBULA MEND THE EMPTY FUEL CELLS UNDER THE FLOOR.

                    TONY (O.S.)
          The fuel cells were cracked during
          battle, but we figured out a way to
          reverse the ion charge. Bought
          ourselves about 48 hours of flight
          time. Problem is that was
          about...49 hours ago.


EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE WATCH THE BENATAR DRIFT IN SPACE.
                                                             4


                    TONY (O.S.)
          Which means, we're dead in the
          water. A thousand light years from
          the nearest 7-11.


INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK

Tony hands Nebula the last of A PURPLE POWDER.   She pushes it
back to him.

                    TONY (O.S.)
          Most of the quote-unquote `food'
          and potable water ran out two weeks
          ago.


INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

Tony stands on the flight deck, one hand resting on the
glass, staring into the unknown.

                    TONY
          Pep, I know I said no more
          surprises. But, I gotta say, I was
          really hoping to pull off one last
          one. But it looks like...well, you
          know what it looks like.


INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

Back to now.   Tony records his thoughts into his helmet.

                    TONY
          Don't feel bad about this. I mean,
          actually, if you grovel for a
          couple weeks, and then move on with
          enormous guilt...I should probably
          lie down for a minute, rest my
          eyes. Please know, when I drift
          off, it will be like every day
          lately. I'm fine, totally fine.
          I'm going to dream about you. It's
          always you.

Tony switches the helmet off.

                                                 TIME CUT:

NEBULA finds TONY SPRAWLED ON THE FLOOR.

                                                 TIME CUT:
                                                               5


Nebula helps Tony into Quill's chair. Tony slumps,
completely still. Nebula gives him his privacy.

Move in on Tony's face as...A LIGHT SLOWLY GROWS BRIGHTER.
Soon, the entire flight deck glows as bright as a sun.

Nebula appears from the galley, shading her eyes. Tony's
eyelids flutter. Finally, he opens them to see...

CAPTAIN MARVEL (CAROL DANVERS) hovering in space.


INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, BATHROOM - NIGHT

STEVE ROGERS shaves.

He studies himself in the mirror, exhausted. He's about to
tap his razor in the sink's standing water, when...

THE WATER RIPPLES. Steve stares a beat, puzzled.      Then the
lamp catches his eye...SWAYING GENTLY.

Just then, a sound roars overhead.   Steve turns...


EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - NIGHT

THE MOON HANGS HUGE OVER THE EARTH. Then the silhouette of
THE BENATAR races past, propelled by CAROL DANVERS.

Below...STEVE ROGERS, BRUCE BANNER, AND NATASHA ROMANOV watch
a flying woman guide the ship to the ground.

Behind them, PEPPER POTTS walks up to the group.

                                                   TIME CUT:

Steve races up as NEBULA helps Tony down the ramp.

                    TONY
          I couldn't stop him.

                    STEVE
          Neither could we.

                    TONY
          I lost the kid.

                     STEVE
              (unable to say it all)
          We...lost...

                    TONY
          Is Pepper...?
                                                              6


JUST THEN, PEPPER POTTS THROWS HERSELF INTO TONY'S ARMS.

                    PEPPER POTTS
          Stay here, you stay right here-

                    TONY
          I'm not going anywhere.

NEARBY, NEBULA watches the sad humans. ROCKET SITS BESIDE
HER, GRATEFUL. She rests a hand on his furry head.


INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

RHODEY, TONY, STEVE, NATASHA, AND CAROL watch...

A HOLO-DISPLAY ROTATING THROUGH FACES OF PEOPLE WE'VE LOST:
WANDA. VISION. BUCKY. T'CHALLA. MARIA HILL.

                    RHODEY
          It's been twenty-three days since
          Thanos came to Earth.

TONY, weak, sits in a hi-tech wheelchair, IV dripping into
his arm. He stares, taking in the loss:

SAM WILSON. SECRETARY ROSS. SHARON CARTER.      SCOTT LANG.
HOPE VAN DYNE. HANK PYM. NICK FURY.

At Fury, Carol bites back emotion.

                    NATASHA
          World governments are in pieces, as
          you can imagine. But the parts
          that still work are trying to take
          a census. It looks like he did
          what he said he was going to do.

JANE FOSTER. ERIK SELVIG. WONG. DR. STRANGE. THE BARTON
FAMILY. QUILL. DRAX. MANTIS. GROOT. PETER PARKER.

Finally, Tony looks away.   RHODEY turns it off.

                    NATASHA (CONT'D)
          Thanos wiped out fifty percent of
          all the living creatures on Earth.

                    CAROL DANVERS
          Not just Earth.

                    RHODEY
          You sure about that?
                                                 7


                    CAROL DANVERS
          You never have to ask me that.

                    TONY
          Where is he now?

                    STEVE
          We don't know. He just opened a
          portal and walked through.

Tony looks out to see...THOR on the patio.

                    TONY
          What's his deal?

                    ROCKET (O.S.)
          He's pissed.

Tony turns to see Rocket for the first time.

                    ROCKET (CONT'D)
          He thinks he failed. Which, of
          course, he did. But there's a lot
          of that going around, ain't there?

                    TONY
          Until this second, I literally
          thought you were a Build-a-Bear.

                    STEVE
          We've been hunting Thanos for three
          weeks - deep space scans,
          satellites - we got nothing. Tony,
          you fought him-

                    TONY
          Who told you that? I didn't fight
          him, he wiped my face with a planet
          while a Bleecker Street magician
          gave away the store. There was no
          fight because he's not beatable.

                    STEVE
          Did he give you anything to go on?
          Clues, coordinates-

Tony stares, lost, barely acknowledging Steve.

                    TONY
          I saw this coming, few years back.
          Didn't wanna believe. I thought I
          was dreaming...
                                                8


                    STEVE
          Tony, I need you to focus-

                    TONY
          And I needed you, as in past tense.
          That trumps what you need. It's
          too late, buddy. You know what I
          need?

Tony turns to everyone, slightly unstable.

                     TONY (CONT'D)
          I need a shave and a burger, not a
          bowl of soup.
              (stands)
          And I believe I remember telling
          all of you, alive and otherwise,
          that we needed a suit of armor
          around the world, whether it
          impacted our precious freedoms or
          not-

                    STEVE
          But that didn't work out, did it?

                    TONY
          I said we'd lose, you said we'd ""do
          that together, too."" Guess what,
          Cap, we lost, and you weren't
          there. But that's what we do,
          right? Our best work after the
          fact? We're the ""Avengers"", not
          the ""Pre-vengers-""

                    RHODEY
          Tony, take it easy...

                     TONY
          I've got nothing for ya, Cap. No
          coordinates, no clues, no
          strategies, no options. Zero, zip,
          nada. No trust.
              (rips out RT)
          Here. You take this. You find
          him, you put this on, and hide.
              (drops to his knees)
          I'm fine!

Tony COLLAPSES.   Rhodey catches him.
                                                            9


INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CORRIDOR - DAY

CAROL, STEVE, AND NATASHA stare through GLASS DOORS at TONY
IN A HOSPITAL BED, PEPPER AND BANNER AT HIS SIDE.

RHODEY STEPS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL ROOM.

                    RHODEY
          Bruce gave him a sedative. Should
          be out the rest of the day.

                     CAROL DANVERS
              (heading for the lab)
          Take care of him. When I come
          back, I'll bring a bottle of
          Xorrian elixir.

                    STEVE
          Where are you going?

                    CAROL DANVERS
          To kill Thanos.


INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

NATASHA catches up to CAROL IN THE WORKSHOP.

                    NATASHA
          Hey, hey, hang on. We're sort of a
          team here. Between you and me,
          morale's a little fragile.

                    CAROL DANVERS
          Oh, I'm sorry. My fault.

Carol sees Steve and Rhodey catch up.    She claps her hands.

                    CAROL DANVERS (CONT'D)
          All right, team! I'm going to go
          kill Thanos. Message me if you get
          any intel that can help.
          Otherwise, I'll report back when
          he's dead. Great work, everybody.

                    STEVE
          Look, we realize ""up there's"" more
          your territory, but this is our
          fight, too.

                    RHODEY
          Do you even know where he is?
                                                          10


                    CAROL DANVERS
          I know people who might-

                    NEBULA (O.S.)
          Don't bother.

They all turn to see NEBULA in THE LIVING AREA DOORWAY.

                    NEBULA (CONT'D)
          I can tell you where Thanos is.


INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - DAY

STEVE, NATASHA, RHODEY, BANNER, ROCKET, THOR, and CAROL
gather. NEBULA studies her robotic hand.

                    NEBULA
          Thanos spent a long time trying
          to...perfect me. When he worked,
          he talked. About his Great Plan.
          Even disassembled, I wanted to
          please him. I'd ask, where would
          we go once his plan was complete?
          His answer was always the same: ""To
          the Garden.""

                    RHODEY
          You're saying Thanos had a
          retirement plan.

                    STEVE
          Where's this garden?

ROCKET brings up EARTH on A HOLO-MAP. A BRIGHT SURGE OF
ENERGY ENVELOPS THE PLANET (EMANATING FROM WAKANDA).

                    ROCKET
          When Thanos snapped his fingers,
          Earth become ground zero for a
          power surge of ridiculously cosmic
          proportions. No one's seen
          anything like it.

He shifts the map, crossing billions of light years, to...AN
IDENTICAL SURGE ENVELOPING A MYSTERIOUS, ORANGE PLANET.

                    ROCKET (CONT'D)
          Until two days ago.

                    NATASHA
          You're saying he snapped his
          fingers again. Where?
                                                           11


Rocket zooms the holo-image toward a cluster of stars...

                    NEBULA
          Planet is unnamed, but inhabitable.
          Rich atmosphere, good soil-

                       STEVE
          A garden.

                    BRUCE BANNER
          Thanos is there. And he just used
          the stones.

Steve eyes everyone.    THOR FINALLY LOOKS UP.

                     BRUCE BANNER (CONT'D)
              (thinking of himself)
          You know, we'd be going short-
          handed.

                    RHODEY
          Because he killed all our friends.

                    ROCKET
          Are we saying they're dead?    We're
          using that word now?

                    RHODEY
          He's still got the stones.

                    CAROL DANVERS
          So, we take them. And we use them
          to bring everybody back.

                    BRUCE BANNER
          Just like that?

                      STEVE
          Yeah.    Just like that.

No one speaks.    Finally...

                    NATASHA
          If there's even the smallest chance
          we can undo this, then we owe it to
          everyone who's not sitting here to
          try.

Everyone looks around the room...AGREED.

                    BRUCE BANNER
          If we do this...why would it end
          any differently than it did before?
                                                           12


                    CAROL DANVERS
          Because before you didn't have me.

                    RHODEY
          Hey, new girl. All of us in here
          are about that superhero life.
          Where've you been all this time?

                    CAROL DANVERS
          There's a lot of people in the
          universe. And they didn't all have
          you.

THOR STANDS. He crosses to Carol and holds out his hand.
STORMBREAKER WHIPS PAST HER HEAD, RUFFLING HER HAIR.

Carol doesn't flinch.   Thor smiles.

                    THOR
          I like this one.

Steve stares at the planet a long, deciding moment.   Then...

                    STEVE
          Let's go get that son of a bitch.

                                                 SLAM TO:
          TITLE: ""AVENGERS: ENDGAME""


INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - DAWN

EVERYONE settles into their seats on the Benatar's flight
deck. STEVE WATCHES EARTH GROW SMALLER THROUGH THE WINDOW.

                      CAROL DANVERS
          Trust me.    You get used to it.

ROCKET looks around from the pilot's chair.

                    ROCKET
          Okay, who here hasn't been to
          space?

STEVE, NATASHA, and RHODEY half-raise their hands.

                    ROCKET (CONT'D)
          Oh, you're gonna hate this.

                    NEBULA
          Approaching jump in three, two...

STEVE'S FINGERS TIGHTEN on the arm rest as...
                                                            13


EXT. BENATAR - DAWN

WHOOSH!   THE BENATAR WARPS, LEAPING INTO JUMP SPACE.


EXT. SPACE - DAY

WHOOSH! THE BENATAR ARRIVES ABOVE AN OMINOUS, ORANGE PLANET.
As the ship maintains orbit, CAROL flies toward the planet.

                      CAROL DANVERS
           I'll head down for recon. If I'm
           not back in fifteen, you'll know I
           found him.


INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - SPACE

OUR HEROES wait on the flight deck, tense.

NATASHA looks at STEVE, who's staring at...A COMPASS: PEGGY
CARTER'S YELLOWED PHOTO STILL RESTS INSIDE.

                     NATASHA
           This is going to work, Steve.

                      STEVE
           I know it will.
               (beat)
           Because I don't know what I'm going
           to do if it doesn't.

JUST THEN, CAROL FLIES UP TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS.

                     CAROL DANVERS (OVER COM)
           No satellites, no ships, no armies.
           No ground defenses of any kind.
           It's just him.

                     NEBULA
           That's enough.

The Avengers exchange a look.


EXT. TITAN-2 - DAY

SMOKE CURLS FROM THE CHIMNEY OF A SOLITARY LODGE.


INT. THANOS' LODGE - DAY

A POT BOILS OVER A FIRE. Then...THANOS LIMPS TOWARD IT, LEFT
SIDE PARALYZED, arm blackened. A shell of his former self.
                                                            14


He stirs the pot. Suddenly, AN ARMORED HAND BURSTS FROM THE
FIRE, GRABBING THANOS' GAUNTLET...

PREVENTING THANOS FROM CLOSING HIS FIST.

Thanos jerks back as HULKBUSTER SPRINGS INSIDE. CAROL AND
RHODEY BASH THROUGH THE ROOF, PINNING THANOS' ARMS.

THOR crashes through the door, followed by the others.     HE
SWINGS STORMBREAKER...CUTTING OFF THANOS' HAND.

The Gauntlet lands at Rocket's feet. He picks it up...and
his face goes slack. He turns the glove toward the others.

And we now realize...THE INFINITY STONES ARE GONE.

                    STEVE
          Where are they?

Thanos doesn't answer.   CAROL PRESSES HIM TO HIS KNEES.

                    CAROL DANVERS
          Answer the question!

                    THANOS
          The universe required correction.
          After that, the stones served no
          purpose beyond temptation.

                    BRUCE BANNER
          You murdered trillions.

                    THANOS
          You should be grateful.

                    NATASHA
          Where are the stones?

                     THANOS
          Gone.   Reduced to atoms.

                    BRUCE BANNER
          You used them two days ago!

                    THANOS
          I used the stones to destroy the
          stones. It nearly killed me.
          But the work is done. It always
          will be.

That lands, sickening.   ROCKET SEARCHES, FRANTIC, NEAR TEARS.

                    ROCKET
          No...they can't be gone...
                                                            15


                    RHODEY
          He's lying.

                    NEBULA
          My father is many things.   A liar
          is not one of them.

                    THANOS
          Thank you, daughter.    Perhaps I've
          treated you-

SWOOSH. THOR'S AXE SEVERS THANOS' HEAD FROM HIS BODY. IT
HITS THE FLOOR, FOLLOWED BY THE THUD OF HIS HUGE FRAME.

                    ROCKET
          What did you do?

Thor just stares, his long journey a failure.

                    THOR
          I went for the head.

As Thor walks away, Steve looks at Thanos' head on the
ground. IT'S OVER. THEY LOST.

                                               FADE TO BLACK.

OVER BLACK: ""FIVE YEARS LATER.""


EXT. PORT OF NEW YORK - DAY

A CAR CRUSHER flattens an Audi. THOUSANDS MORE NEVER-DRIVEN
CARS LIE STACKED ON THE DOCKS, WAITING THEIR TURN.


EXT. NEW YORK - DAY

A HUGE TARP flaps over the shuttered LINCOLN CENTER.


EXT. SHEA STADIUM - DAY

A TEENAGE GIRL rides her skateboard, alone in a weed-filled
parking lot. Pull back to see THE EMPTY STADIUM BEHIND HER.


INT. BROOKLYN COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

A POSTER SHOWS A SINGLE FIGURE STARING AT A GROUP OF SHADOWS.
IT READS, ""WHERE DO WE GO, NOW THAT THEY'RE GONE?""

The bottom reads, ""BROOKLYN SUPPORT GROUP, TUESDAYS 8PM.""
                                                  16


A GRIEVING MAN speaks in A RECOVERY GROUP.

                    GRIEVING MAN
          So, I went on a date the other day.

                    JIMMY
          Good job, Bobby.   Back in the game.

                     GRIEVING MAN
          Thank you, Jimmy.
              (to the group)
          First in five years. I sat there
          at dinner thinking, what are we
          even supposed to talk about?

STEVE ROGERS, thinner, older, LISTENS INTENTLY.

                    STEVE
          What did you talk about?

                    GRIEVING MAN
          Same old crap. How much things
          have changed. How much we miss the
          Mets. My job, his job. Then it
          got kind of quiet. He cried during
          the salads.

                    OLDER MAN
          What about you?

                    GRIEVING MAN
          I cried just before dessert. But
          I'm seeing him again tomorrow.
          So...

                      STEVE
          That's great. You've already done
          the hardest part. You took a jump,
          didn't know where you'd come down.
          And that's it, those little brave
          baby steps we've gotta take. To
          try to make us feel whole again, to
          find a purpose...
              (to everyone)
          I went into the ice right after I
          met the love of my life. Woke up
          seventy years later and...had to
          keep going.

The group takes this in.
                                                            17


                    STEVE (CONT'D)
          The world's been left in our hands.
          If we don't do something with
          it...then Thanos might as well have
          killed all of us.

People nod, but Steve seems unconvinced by his own words.


EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

THE CAMERA ROTATES down from the sky onto a strangely quiet
San Francisco, until it finds...A STORAGE WAREHOUSE.


INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, UNIT 277 - DAY

LUIS' VAN sits in a storage unit, surrounded by boxes: ""S.
LANG, KITCHEN, S. LANG, CLOTHES.""

THROUGH THE VAN WINDOWS, we see...HANK PYM'S QUANTUM TUNNEL.

A MEANDERING RAT CRAWLS ONTO THE CONTROLS. IT ACCIDENTALLY
STEPS ON A TOGGLE SWITCH and...A LIGHT GOES GREEN. FLASH.

THE BACK DOORS OF THE VAN BLOW OPEN, revealing...SCOTT LANG,
ANT-MAN suit shorting. He retracts his helmet, gasping.


INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

A GUARD reads THE TERMINAL BEACH, by J.G. Ballard. He looks
up at a monitor: SCOTT LANG holds up a sign, ""HELP.""


EXT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE - DAY

A dented WAGON rolls over a speed-bump. Scott, in his old
clothes, slowly wheels his belongings away.

The Guard watches him go, puzzled.


EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, STREET - DAY

Scott walks A STREET OF ABANDONED HOMES.

                    SCOTT LANG
          Hello?

He hears A CLACKING. A KID on a bicycle rides by, playing
card wedged between his spokes.

Scott waves him down.   The kid stops.
                                                             18


                        SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
          Hey.   Kid.     What happened here?

The kid says nothing. He just stares at Scott with a haunted
look. Then he stands on his pedal and keeps riding.

CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK...


EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY

STONE MONUMENTS loom in a park. A small crowd mills.      Reveal
Scott looking over the monuments, lost.

                                                    TIME CUT:

Scott walks up to the obelisks. At the top, they read: ""THE
VANISHED."" Hundreds of names line the stones.

He scans the ""L's,"" finally finding, ""SCOTT LANG.""

                     SCOTT LANG
          What?
              (realizing)
          Cassie...


EXT. MAGGIE LANG'S HOUSE - DAY

A winded Scott races up the sidewalk toward his old house.
He leaps a bush, banging on the front door.

                     SCOTT LANG
          Cassie!   Cassie!

SOON, A TEEN GIRL opens the door, shocked.      A very long beat.

                        CASSIE LANG
          Dad?

                        SCOTT LANG
          Peanut?

Scott wraps his arms around CASSIE LANG (14), now five years
older than when he last saw her. She hugs him, CRYING.

                    CASSIE LANG
          I thought you were gone.

                    SCOTT LANG
          I'm sorry. I'm back...I'm
          back...I'm back...
                                                            19


EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, FRONT GATE - DAWN

Avengers Compound stands amidst overgrown grass.    Rusty
chains lock the gate.

Faded signs warn: ""RESTRICTED AREA.    KEEP OUT.""


INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - NIGHT

NATASHA SITS SURROUNDED BY HOLO-SCREENS FEATURING CAROL
DANVERS, RHODEY, ROCKET AND NEBULA, AND OKOYE.

                    ROCKET (HOLO)
          We boarded that ""highly suspect
          warship"" Danvers pinged.

                    NATASHA
          And?

                    NEBULA (HOLO)
          It was an infectious garbage scow.

                    ROCKET (HOLO)
          So thanks for the hot tip-

                    CAROL DANVERS (HOLO)
          You were closer.

                    ROCKET (HOLO)
          And now we smell like garbage-

                     NATASHA
              (to Okoye)
          You get a reading on those tremors?

                    OKOYE (HOLO)
          Minor subduction in the African
          plate.

                    NATASHA
          Do we have a visual?   How are you
          handling it?

                    OKOYE (HOLO)
          Nat. It was a mild earthquake.      In
          the ocean. We handle it by not
          handling it.

Natasha looks burdened.   Rhodey steps in.
                                                         20


                    RHODEY (HOLO)
          I can have NASA redirect a
          satellite, do a sweep just to make
          sure.

                    NATASHA
          Thanks. Carol, you're still coming
          our way next month?

                    CAROL DANVERS (HOLO)
          Not likely.

                    ROCKET (HOLO)
          Getting another haircut?

                    CAROL DANVERS (HOLO)
          Listen, fur-face, I'm covering a
          lot of territory out here. The
          things that have been happening on
          Earth have been happening
          everywhere else. On thousands of
          planets. You might not see me for
          a long time.

                    NATASHA
          All right. Everybody keep keeping
          their eyes open. This channel's
          always active. Anything goes
          sideways, anyone makes trouble
          where they shouldn't, it comes
          through me.

They ad lib their goodbyes as they sign off, except Rhodey.

                       NATASHA (CONT'D)
          What's up?     Where are you?

                     RHODEY (HOLO)
          Mexico.   Got some news.

                       NATASHA
          Okay...

                    RHODEY
          Federal�s found a room full of
          bodies outside Juarez. Cartel
          guys. Guns still in their pants.

                    NATASHA
          Could be a rival hit-

                    RHODEY
          But it wasn't. Same MO as
          Marseille. And Kiev.
                    (MORE)
                                                          21

                     RHODEY (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          It's definitely Barton.

She nods, grim, reluctantly accepting.

                    RHODEY (CONT'D)
          What he's done here...what he's
          been doing...I got to tell you,
          part of me doesn't want to find
          him.

Natasha just stares a long beat.

                    NATASHA
          Find out where's he going next.

Rhodey nods, signing off.   Natasha sits there, THEN CRUMPLES.

After a long beat...

                    STEVE (O.S.)
          I'd offer to cook you dinner but
          you seem sad enough already.

Natasha turns to see STEVE in the doorway.

                    NATASHA
          Come by to do your laundry?

                    STEVE
          And see a friend.

                    NATASHA
          Your friend's fine.

                    STEVE
          She leave the house today?

                    NATASHA
          Nothing out there I particularly
          want to see.

                    STEVE
          I spotted a pod of whales coming
          over the bridge.

                     NATASHA
              (dubious)
          In the Hudson.

                    STEVE
          Fewer ships, cleaner water. Just
          saying, there's still a world out
          there.
                                                         22


                    NATASHA
          If you're about to tell me to look
          on the bright side, I'm about to
          hit you with a peanut butter
          sandwich.

Steve relents, LETTING DOWN HIS FACADE.

                     STEVE
          Sorry.   Force of habit.

                    NATASHA
          I don't know how you do it.

Steve bites into the uneaten half of her sandwich.

                    STEVE
          I guess I don't know how not to.

                    NATASHA
          Me, neither.

After a long moment, Steve looks up at her, honest.

                    STEVE
          I keep telling them, move on. Grow
          past it. And some of them actually
          do. But not us.

                    NATASHA
          If I move on, who does this?

                    STEVE
          Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

Natasha takes that in. Steve is thinking of giving up.   She
looks around at Avengers Compound.

                    NATASHA
          I used to have nothing. Then I got
          this. This job, this family. And
          I was better because of it.

She chokes slightly, collecting herself.

                    NATASHA (CONT'D)
          And even though they're gone, I'm
          still trying to be...better.

                    STEVE
          I think we both need to get a life.

                       NATASHA
          You first.
                                                          23


They stare at each other a long, melancholy moment.

THEN, WE HEAR A PING. NATASHA SWIPES TO A CCTV DISPLAY:
SCOTT LANG'S FACE FILLS A SCREEN, LUIS' VAN BEHIND HIM.

                    SCOTT LANG (ON SCREEN)

                                   Revised Third Draft

                                      July 15, 1991

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. A SENTRY TOWER --

               -- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.

               Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower 
               cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable 
               sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very 
               faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts, 
               we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible 
               now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the 
               steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure 
               and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT 
               POST, maybe forty feet off the ground.

               Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding 
               a rifle and staring straight out.

               The drum cadence has been building slightly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE. And we see by the moonlight 
               that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into 
               the distance.

               SUBTITLE: UNITED STATES NAVAL BASE GUANTANAMO BAY - CUBA.

               The drum cadence continues, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A MARINE BARRACKS

               We HEAR two pairs of footsteps and then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR

               where we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY, 
               two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop 
               when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still 
               growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it 
               slowly.  He opens's the door and they walk into

               INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - NIGHT

               WILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in 
               his bunk.

               DAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S 
               shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks 
               at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --

               -- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out 
               of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and 
               DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come 
               out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth.

               Everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision 
               and professionalism.

               -- A strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto 
               his mouth and eyes --

               -- A length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (quietly)
                         You're lucky it's us, Willy.

               -- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking 
               him, just holding his head still --

               -- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo. We HEAR four 
               sharp blasts from a whistle and we

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - DAY

               and the drum cadence we've been hearing has turned into Semper 
               Fidelis and it's coming from THE U.S. MARINE CORPS BAND, a 
               sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished 
               silver and brass.

               The BAND is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds 
               before a crowd made up mostly of TOURISTS and DAY-CAMPERS.

               As the TITLES ROLL, we watch the BAND do their thing from 
               various angles. Incredible precision is the name of the game. 
               Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were 
               all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same 
               fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM 
               that can't possibly be human. Flags, banners, the works.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A RED BRICK BUILDING - DAY

               It's an important building, a main building. A few SAILORS 
               enter and exit and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A WOMAN

               as she walks across the courtyard toward the brick building.  
               The WOMAN is JOANNE GALLOWAY, a navy lawyer in her early 
               30's. She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency 
               to speak quickly. If she had any friends, they'd call her 
               JO. As she walks, she mutters to herself ...

                                     JO
                         I'm requesting... I'm... Captain, 
                         I'd like to request that I be the 
                         attorney assigned to rep -- I'd like 
                         to request that it be myself who is 
                         assigned to represent --
                              (she stops)
                         ""That it be myself who is assigned 
                         to represent""? ...Good, Jo, that's 
                         confidence inspiring.

               We follow JO, still muttering, as she walks into the brick 
               building which bears the seal of the

               UNITED STATES NAVY - JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL'S CORPS

               As JO  enters. CAPTAIN WEST and two other officers, GIBBS 
               and LAWRENCE, sit around a conference table.

                         Yes sir... This past Friday evening.  
                         Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson 
                         and Private Louden Downey, entered 
                         the barracks room of a PFC William 
                         Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago 
                         died at the base hospital 
                         approximately an hour later. The NIS 
                         agent who took their statements 
                         maintains they were trying to prevent 
                         Santiago from naming them in a 
                         fenceline shooting incident. They're 
                         scheduled to have a hearing down in 
                         Cuba at 4:00 this afternoon.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         What's the problem?

                                     JO
                         Dawson and Downey are both recruiting 
                         poster marines and Santiago was known 
                         to be a screw-up. I was thinking 
                         that it sounded an awful lot like a 
                         code red.

               Jo lets this sink in a moment.

                                     WEST
                              (under his breath)
                         Christ.

                                     JO
                         I'd like them moved up to Washington 
                         and assigned counsel. Someone who 
                         can really look into this. Someone 
                         who possesses not only the legal 
                         skill, but a familiarity with the 
                         inner workings of the military. In 
                         short, Captain, I'd like to suggest 
                         that... I be the one who, that it be 
                         me who is assigned to represent them.
                              (beat)
                         Myself.

               Jo looks around the room for a response.

                                     WEST
                         Joanne, why don't you get yourself a 
                         cup of coffee.

                                     JO
                         Thank you, sir, I'm fine.

                                     WEST
                         Joanne, I'd like you to leave the 
                         room so we can talk about you behind 
                         your back.

                                     JO
                         Certainly, sir.

               JO gets up and walks out.

                                     WEST
                         I thought this Code Red shit wasn't 
                         going on anymore.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         With the marines at GITMO? Who the 
                         hell knows what goes on down there.

                                     WEST
                         Well lets find out before the rest 
                         of the world does, this thing could 
                         get messy. What about this woman?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Jo's been working a desk at internal 
                         affairs for what, almost a year now.

                                     WEST

                         Three cases in two years? Who was 
                         she handling, the Rosenbergs?

                                     GIBBS
                         She's not cut out for litigation.

                         She's a hall of an investigator, 
                         Jerry --

                         In Internal Affairs, sure. She can 
                         crawl up a lawyer's ass with the 
                         best of 'em, but when it comes to 
                         trial work --

                                     WEST
                         I know. All passion, no street smarts. 
                         Bring her back in.

               LAWRENCE goes to the door and motions for JO to come back 
               in.

                                     WEST
                              (continuing)
                         Commander, we're gonna move the 
                         defendants up here in the morning.

                                     JO
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     WEST
                         And I'll have Division assign them 
                         counsel...

                                     JO
                              (beat)
                         But... not me.

                                     WEST
                         From what I understand from your 
                         colleagues, you're much too valuable 
                         in your present assignment to be 
                         wasted on what I'm sure will boil 
                         down to a five minute plea bargain 
                         and a week's worth of paper work.

                                     JO
                         Sir --

                                     WEST
                         Don't worry about it. I promise you, 
                         division'll assign the right man for 
                         the job.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

               THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB

               His name is LIEUTENANT JUNIOR GRADE DANIEL ALLISTAIR KAFFEE, 
               and it's almost impossible not to like him. At the moment 
               he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen LAWYERS who are spread 
               out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. The '27 
               Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own 
               against a group of, say, Airforce dentists.

               KAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law 
               School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous 
               spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life, 
               passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (calling out to the 
                              team)
                         Alright, let's get two!

               He smacks one to the SECOND BASE. The ball bounces right 
               between his legs.

                                     SECOND BASE
                         Sorry!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.  
                         Just look the ball into your glove.

               He smacks one out to the same place. It bounces off the heel 
               of SHERBY's glove and into center field.

                                     SECOND BASE (SHERBY)
                         Sorry!

                                     KAFFEE
                         You gotta trust me, Sherby. You keep 
                         your eyes open, your chances of 
                         catching the ball increase by a factor 
                         of ten.

               SPRADLING, a young naval officer, sweaty and out of breath, 
               walks up behind the backstop.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Let's try it again.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee!!

                                     KAFFEE
                              (turning)
                         Dave. You seem upset and distraught.

                                     SPRADLING
                         We were supposed to meet in your 
                         office 15 minutes ago to talk about 
                         the McDermott case. You're stalling 
                         on this thing. Now we got this done 
                         and I mean now, or no kidding, Kaffee, 
                         I'll hang your boy from a fuckin' 
                         yardarm.

                                     KAFFEE
                         A yardarm?
                              (calling out)
                         Sherby, does the Navy still hang 
                         people from yardarms?

                                     SHERBY
                              (calling back)
                         I don't think so, Danny.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (back to SPRADLING)
                         Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy 
                         hangs people from yardarms anymore.
                              (back to the field)
                         Let's go, let's get two!

               He goes back to hitting fungoes.

                                     SPRADLING
                         I'm gonna charge him with possession 
                         and being under the influence while 
                         on duty. Plead guilty and I'll 
                         recommend 30 days in the brig with 
                         loss of rank and pay.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It was oregano, Dave, it was ten 
                         dollars worth of oregano.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Yeah, well your client thought it 
                         was marijuana.

                                     KAFFEE
                         My client's a moron, that's not 
                         against the law.

               Swapp! The THIRD BASEMAN takes one in the face.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Ow. That had to hurt.
                              (calling out)
                         Way to keep your head in the play, 
                         Lester. Walk it off!

                                     SPRADLING
                         I've got people to answer to just 
                         like you, I'm gonna charge him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         With what, possession of a condiment?

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dave, I've tried to help you out of 
                         this, but if you ask for tall time, 
                         I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.

                                     SPRADLING
                         You won't got it.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I will get it. And if the MTD is 
                         denied, I'll file a motion in liminee 
                         seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling 
                         in advance, and after that I'm gonna 
                         file against pre-trial confinement, 
                         and you're gonna spend an entire 
                         summer going blind on paperwork 
                         because a Signalman Second Class 
                         bought and smoked a dime bag of 
                         oregano.

                         'Cause you have wisdom beyond your 
                         years. Dave, can you play third base?

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               About 16 NAVY AND MARINE LAWYERS (several of whom are women) 
               are taking their seats around a large conference table.

               A PARALEGAL is handing out folders and some photocopied papers 
               to the LAWYERS.

               We might notice that one of the lawyers is Lieutenant Junior 
               Grade SAM WEINBERG. Sam's serious and studious looking. If 
               he weren't in uniform, you wouldn't guess that he was a naval 
               officer.

               CAPTAIN WHITAKER walks in.

                                     WHITAKER
                         'Morning.

                              (school class)
                         'Morning Captain Whitaker.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Sam, how's the baby?

                                     SAM
                         I think she's ready to say her first 
                         word any day now.

                                     WHITAKER
                         How can you tell?

                                     SAM
                         She just looks like she has something 
                         to say.

               KAFFEE walks in.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Excuse me, sorry I'm late.

                                     WHITAKER
                         I'm sure you don't have a good excuse, 
                         so I won't force you to come up with 
                         a bad one.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you, Isaac, that's nice of 
                         you.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Sit-down, this first one's for you.

               He hands KAFFEE some files.

                                     WHITAKER
                              (continuing)
                         You're moving up in the world, Danny, 
                         you've been requested by Division.

               ""Oooh""'s and ""Ahhh""'S from the other LAWYERS. (Subtle Note: 
               Kaffee doesn't want to move up in the world.)

                                     KAFFEE
                         Requested to do what?

               WHITAKER hands him a file.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A marine 
                         corporal named Dawson illegally fires 
                         a round from his weapon over the 
                         fenceline and into Cuban territory.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What's a fenceline?

                                     WHITAKER
                         Sam?

                                     SAM
                         A big wall separating the good guys 
                         from the bad guys.

                         PFC William Santiago threatens to 
                         rat on Dawson to the Naval 
                         investigative Service. Dawson and 
                         another member of his squad, PFC 
                         Louden Downey, they go into Santiago's 
                         room, tie him up, and stuff a rag 
                         down his throat. An hour later, 
                         Santiago's dead. Attending physician 
                         says the rag was treated with some 
                         kind of toxin.

                                     KAFFEE
                         They poisoned the rag?

                                     WHITAKER
                         Not according to them.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What do they say?

                                     WHITAKER
                         Not much. They're being flown up 
                         here tomorrow and on Thursday at 
                         0600 you'll catch a transport down 
                         to Cuba for the day to find out what 
                         you can. Meantime, go across the 
                         yard and see Lt. Commander Joanne 
                         Galloway. She's the one who had 'em 
                         brought up here. She'll fill you in 
                         on whatever she has. Any questions?

                                     KAFFEE
                         The flight to Cuba, was that 0600 in 
                         the morning, sir?

                                     WHITAKER
                         It seems important to Division that 
                         this one be handled by the book, so 
                         I'm assigning co-counsel. Any 
                         volunteers?

                                     SAM
                         No.

                         I have a stack of paper on my desk --

                         Doing what? Kaffee'll finish this up 
                         in four days.

                                     WHITAKER

                         In other words I have no 
                         responsibilities whatsoever.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Right.

               INT. JO'S OFFICE - DAY

               JO sits behind her desk. KAFFEE and SAM stand in the doorway. 
               KAFFEE knocks politely.

               JO looks up.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Hi.
                              (beat)
                         I'm Daniel Kaffee. I was told to 
                         meet with --
                              (checks notes)
                         -- Commander Galloway.

               JO is staring at him. KAFFEE doesn't know why.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         About a briefing.

               JO is finding this hard to believe.

                                     JO
                         You're the attorney that Division 
                         assigned?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm lead counsel. This is Sam 
                         Weinberg.

                                     SAM
                         I have no responsibilities here 
                         whatsoever.

               JO's deeply puzzled.

                                     JO
                              (beat)
                         Come in, please, have a seat...

               KAFFEE and SAM come into the office and sit.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Lieutenant, how long have you been 
                         in the Navy?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Going on nine months now.

                                     JO
                         And how long have you been out of 
                         law school?

                                     KAFFEE
                         A little over a year.

                                     JO
                              (beat)
                         I see.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Have I done something wrong?

                                     JO
                         No. It's just that when I petitioned 
                         Division to have counsel assigned, I 
                         was hoping I'd be taken seriously.

               KAFFEE and SAM exchange a look.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to JO)
                         No offense taken, if you were 
                         wondering.

                                     SAM
                         Commander, Lt. Kaffee's generally 
                         considered the best litigator in our 
                         office. He's successfully plea 
                         bargained 44 cases in nine months.

                                     KAFFEE
                         One more, and I got a set of steak 
                         knives.

                                     JO
                         Have you ever been in a courtroom?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I once had my drivers license 
                         suspended.

                                     SAM
                         Danny --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander, from what I understand, 
                         if this thing goes to court, they 
                         won't need a lawyer, they'll need a 
                         priest.

                                     JO
                         No. They'll need a lawyer.

               During this, she'll hand KAFFEE a series of files, which 
               KAFFEE will pass To SAM without even glancing at them.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Dawson's family has been contacted.  
                         Downey's closest living relative is 
                         Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's 
                         side, she hasn't been Contacted yet.

               None of this really means anything to KAFFEE.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Would you like me to take care of 
                         that?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sure, if you feel like it.

               JO takes another beat to size this guy up.

                                     JO
                         One of the people you'll be speaking 
                         to down there is the barracks C.O., 
                         Colonel Nathan Jessep, I assume you've 
                         heard of him.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Who hasn't?

                              (to KAFFEE)
                         He's been in the papers lately. He's 
                         expected to be appointed Director of 
                         Operations for the National Security 
                         Counsel.

               Passing KAFFEE another file --

                         These are letters that Santiago wrote 
                         in his 8 months at GITMO --

                         commander, HQ, Atlantic, even his 
                         senator. He wanted a transfer. Nobody 
                         was listening. You with me?

                         Yes.

                         in exchange for a transfer, was just 
                         a last ditch effort.

                         look like your client had a motive 
                         to kill Santiago.

          INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

          It is dark; we don't see clearly.  a man and woman make love 
          on a brass bed.  There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling.  
          On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine.  A 
          tape deck PLAYS the Stones ""Sympathy for the Devil.""

          Atop him... she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face.  
          He cups her breasts.  She leans down, kisses him...

          JOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking.  We don't 
          see the woman's face.  She has long blonde hair.  The CAMERA 
          STAYS BEHIND and to the side of them.

          She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth...  she 
          kisses him... she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms 
          above his head.

          She moves higher atop him... she reaches to the side of the 
          bed... a white silk scarf is in her hand... her hips above his 
          face now, moving... slightly, oh-so slightly... his face strains 
          towards her.

          The scarf in her hand... she ties his hands with it...  
          gently... to the brass bed... his eyes are closed...  tighter... 
          lowering hips into his face... lower... over his chest... his 
          navel.  The SONG plays.

          He is inside her... his head arches back... his throat white.

          She arches her back... her hips grind... her breasts are high...

          Her back arches back... back... her head tilts back... she 
          extends her arms... the right arm comes down suddenly...  the 
          steel flashes... his throat is white...

          He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses...

          It flashes up... it flashes down... and up... and down...  and 
          up... and...

          EXT. A BROWNSTONE IN PACIFIC HEIGHTS - MORNING

          Winter in San Francisco cold, foggy.  Cop cars everywhere.  
          The lights play through the thick fog.  Two Homicide detectives 
          get out of the car, walk into the house.

          NICK CURRAN is 42.  Trim, good-looking, a nice suit; a face 
          urban, edged, shadowed.  GUS MORAN is 64.  Crew-cut, silver 
          beard, a suit rumpled and shiny, a hat out of the 50'sa face 
          worn and ruined the face of a backwoods philosopher.

          INT. THE BROWNSTONE

          There's money here -- deco, clean, hip -- That looks like a 
          Picasso on the wall.  They check it out.

                                    GUS
                        Who was this fuckin' guy?

                                    NICK
                        Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.

                                    GUS
                        I never heard of him.

                                    NICK
                               (grins)
                        Before your time, pop.
                               (a beat)
                        Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits.
                        He's got a club down in the Fillmore 
                        now.

                                    GUS
                        Not now he don't.

          Past the uniformed guys... nods... waves... past the forensic 
          men... past the coroner's investigators... they get to the 
          bedroom.

          INT. THE BEDROOM

          They walk in, stare -- it's messy.

          It's like a convention in here.  LT. PHIL WALKER, in his 50's, 
          silver-haired, the Homicide guys; JIM HARRIGAN, late 40's, 
          puffy, affable;  SAM ANDREWS, 30's, black.  A CORONER'S MAN is 
          working the bed.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick and Gus)
                        You guys know Captain Talcott?

          They nod.

                                    GUS
                        What's the Chief's office doin' 
                        here.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        Observing.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to the Coroner's 
                               Guy)
                        What do you think, Doc?

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                        The skin blanches when I press it --
                        this kind of color is about right 
                        for six or eight hours.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Nobody say anything.  The maid 
                        came in an hour ago and found him.
                        She's not a live-in.

                                    GUS
                        Maybe the maid did it.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She's 54 years old and weighs 240 
                        pounds.

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                               (deadpan)
                        There are no bruises on his body.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        It ain't the maid.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        He left the club with his girlfriend 
                        about midnight.  That's the last 
                        time anybody saw him.

                                    NICK
                               (looks at body)
                        What was it?

                                    THE CORONER'S GUY
                        Ice pick.  Left on the coffee table 
                        in the living room.  Thin steel 
                        handle.  Forensics took it downtown.

                                    HARRIGAN
                        There's come all over the sheets --
                        he got off before he got offed.

                                    GUS
                               (deadpan)
                        That rules the maid out for sure.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        This is sensitive.  Mr. Boz was a 
                        major contributor to the mayor's 
                        campaign.  He was Chairman of the 
                        Board of the Palace of Fine Arts --

                                    GUS
                               (to Nick)
                        I thought you said he was a rock 
                        and roll star.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        He was a retired rock and roll 
                        star.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                        A civic-minded, very respectable 
                        rock and roll star.

                                    GUS
                        What's that over there?

          We see the white powder laid out in lines on the small mirror 
          on the side table.

                                    NICK
                               (deadpan)
                        It looks like some civic-minded, 
                        very respectable cocaine to me, 
                        Gus.

                                    CAPT. TALCOTT
                               (evenly, to Nick)
                        Listen to me, Curran.  I'm going 
                        to get a lot of heat on this.  I 
                        don't want any... mistakes.

          Nick and Talcott look at each other a beat, then --

                                    NICK
                        Who's the girlfriend?

          Lt. Walker looks at the notepad in his hand.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Catherine Tramell, 162 Divisadero.

          Nick writes it down.  He and Gus turn, leave.  Captain Talcott 
          watches them.  He looks disturbed.

          INT. THE LIVING ROOM

          As they head out --

                                    NICK
                        Talcott doesn't usually show up at 
                        the office 'till after his 18 holes.  
                        What are they nervous about?

                                    GUS
                        They're executives.  They're nervous 
                        about everything.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Nick!

          He stops, turns, sees Walker behind them.  Walker comes up to 
          them.

                                    LT. WALKER
                               (to Nick)
                        Keep your three o'clock.

                                    NICK
                        Do you want me to work the case, 
                        Phil, or do you want me to --

                                    LT. WALKER
                        I said keep it.

          EXT. A VICTORIAN ON DIVISADERO - DAY

          It is more a mansion than a house.  They ring the bell.  An 
          Hispanic MAID answers.  They flash their badges.

                                    NICK
                        I'm Detective Curran, this is 
                        Detective Moran.  We're with the 
                        San Francisco Police Department.

          We'd like to speak to Ms. Catherine Tramell.

                                    THE MAID
                               (after a beat, an 
                               accent)
                        Just moment.  Come in.

          She leads them into a lavish, beautifully done living room 
          that offers a sweeping view of the Bay.

                                    THE MAID
                        Sit, please.  Just moment.

          They look around, impressed.  There is a Picasso on the wall 
          here, too.

                                    GUS
                        Ain't that cute?  They got his and 
                        her Pig-assos, son.

                               (smiles)
                        I didn't know you knew who Picasso 
                        was, Gus.

                                    GUS
                               (grins)
                        I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just 
                        hide it.

          Nick smiles -- and at that moment a beautiful BLONDE walks 
          into the room.  She looks like she has been asleep.  She is in 
          her early 20's.  She wears a very sheer robe.

                                    NICK
                        We're sorry to disturb you, we'd 
                        like to ask you some --

                                    THE WOMAN
                        Are you vice?

                        When was the last time you saw 
                        John Boz? 

                                    THE WOMAN
                        Is he dead?

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)
                        Why do you think he's dead?

                                    THE WOMAN
                        You wouldn't be here otherwise, 
                        would you?

                                    GUS
                        Were you with him last night?

                                    THE WOMAN
                        You're looking for Catherine, not 
                        me.

                                    NICK
                        Who are you?

                                    THE WOMAN
                        I'm Roxy.
                               (a beat)
                        I'm her -- friend.

          She looks at them a beat.

                                    ROXY
                        She's out at the beach house at 
                        Stinson.  Seadrift.  1402.

                                    NICK
                        Thanks.

          They start to head out.

                                    ROXY
                        You're wasting your time. Catherine 
                        didn't kill him.

          A beat, they look at her, and go...

          EXT. SEADRIFT - STINSON BEACH - DAY

          Foggy.  Cold.  It is an expensive spit of land on the ocean.  
          Multi-million dollar ""beach houses"" with gardens and swimming 
          pools.  There are two Ferraris in the driveway -- one black, 
          one white.

          They get out of the car in front of the house.  They see a 
          woman in back of the house, sitting on a deck chair, staring 
          at the sea, a blanket around her.  As they get to her --

                                    NICK
                        Ms. Tramell?

          She takes a long look a Nick, then looks away.

          CATHERINE TRAMELL is 30 years old.  She has long blonde hair 
          and a refined, classically beautiful face.  She is not knockout 
          gorgeous like Roxy; there is a smoky kind of sensuousness about 
          her.

                                    NICK
                        I'm De...

                                    CATHERINE
                               (evenly)
                        I know who you are.

          She doesn't look at them.  She looks at the water.

                                    CATHERINE
                        How did he die?

                                    GUS
                        He was murdered.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Really.  Maybe that's why you're 
                        from Homicide.  How?

          Nick glances at Gus.

                                    NICK
                        With an ice pick.

          She closes her eyes a beat and then, still staring out, we see 
          a thin smile.  They see it, too, and glance at each other.

                                    NICK
                        How long were you dating him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking 
                        him.

          They glance at each other again.

                                    GUS
                        What are you -- a pro?

          Catherine looks at him -- that thin smile again.

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  I'm an amateur.

          She looks away.

                                    NICK
                        How long were you having sex with 
                        him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        About a year and a half.

                                    NICK
                        Were you with him last night?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.

                                    NICK
                        Did you leave the club with him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.

                                    NICK
                        Did you go home with him?

                                    CATHERINE
                        No.  We had a drink at the club.
                        We left together.  I came here.  
                        He went home.

                                    NICK
                        Was there anyone with you last 
                        night?

                                    CATHERINE
                               (looks at Nick)
                        No.  I wasn't in the mood to have 
                        sex with anyone last night.

          They look at her a beat.

                                    NICK
                        Let me ask you something, Ms.
                        Tramell?  Are you sorry he's dead?

          Catherine looks at him.

                                    CATHERINE
                        Yes.  I liked fucking him.

          They stare at her.  She looks out at the water.

                                    CATHERINE
                        I don't really feel like talking 
                        anymore.

                                    GUS
                        Listen, lady, we can do this 
                        downtown if you --

                                    CATHERINE
                        Read me my rights and arrest me 
                        and I'll go downtown.

          She doesn't even look at them.

                                    CATHERINE
                               (quietly)
                        Otherwise, get the fuck out of 
                        here.  Please.

          A long beat as they look at her.

          INT. A CORRIDOR - POLICE HEADQUARTERS

          The door says Dr. Elizabeth Gardner, Counseling.  Nick opens 
          the door, peeks in.  The receptionist is not there.  A clock 
          says 3.

          INT. THE COUNSELING OFFICE

          He walks in -- sees the inner door open, walks in.

                                    NICK
                        I'm sorry, Beth.  I -- I got hung 
                        up in Stinson.

          DR. ELIZABETH GARDNER, the police psychologist, is a very good-
          looking, dark-haired woman.  She is 30.

                        know I'm fine!  How the hell long 
                        do I have to keep doing this?

                        so we can get it over with, okay?

          He sits down.

                                    BETH
                        So -- how are things?

                        They're fine.

          She watches him closely.

                        My sex life is pretty shitty 
                        actually since I stopped seeing 
                        you -- maybe I should think about 
                        my Electrolux again.

          That embarrassed her; she looks away from him.

                                    NICK
                               (after a beat)

          She shrugs.  A beat.

                        How about the booze?

                        How's not smoking?

                        Thank you.

          And he starts heading out.

          He doesn't even turn, pretends he didn't hear.

          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU

          He walks in.  Gus Moran gets up from his desk as soon as he

          They start heading for Lt. Walker's office.

                        How'd it go, son?

                        She misses me.

          INT. LT. WALKER'S OFFICE

          He and Gus sit there with Lt. Walker, Harrigan, Andrews and

                                    HARRIGAN
                        Sixteen stab wounds to the chest 
                        and neck.  No usable prints, no 
                        forcible entry, nothing missing.

                        it's available at any Safeway.
                        The scarf is Hermes, expensive --

                        The powder was cocaine, high-
                        quality, high-content.  He inhaled 
                        it; there were minute quantities 
                        on his lips and penis.  Mr. Boz 
                        leaves five million dollars, no

                        He liked his coke, he liked his 
                        girls, and he liked rock and roll.

                        He liked the mayor, too, right?

          Talcott gives him a look.

                        I love it.  She's got a hundred 
                        million bucks.  She fucks fighters 
                        and rock and roll stars.  And she's 
                        got a degree in screwing with 
                        peoples' heads.

                        You forgot her degree in literature.  
                        She's a writer.  She published a 
                        novel last year under a pen name.  
                        Do you want to know what it's about?

                        It's about a retired rock and roll

          INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          His apartment is very bare -- very few things -- with wide 
          open spaces.  There is a lot of chrome.

          He sits on the couch, reading a book.  It is a paperback.

          We see the title -- Love Hurts, by Catherine Adams.  He puts 
          the book down a beat, then picks the phone up, dials.

                        does the boyfriend?  With an 
                        icepick, in bed, his hands tied 
                        with a white silk scarf.

          INT. A POLICE DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Nick, Gus, Lt. Walker, Harrigan, Andrews, Captain Talcott --
          and Beth Gardner.  With them is an older, white-haired man, 
          DR. ANDREW LAMOTT.  There are copies of ""Love Hurts"" around 
          the table.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        Dr. Gardner?

                                    BETH
                        I've asked Dr. Lamott to consult 
                        with us.  This isn't really my 
                        turf.  Dr. Lamott teaches the psycho-
                        pathology of psychopathic behavior 
                        at Stanford and is also a member 
                        of the Justice Department's 
                        Psychological Profile team.  Dr.  
                        Lamott?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        There are two possibilities.  One.  
                        The person who wrote this book is 
                        your murderer and acted out the 
                        killing described in ritualistic, 
                        literal detail.  Two.  Someone who 
                        wants to do the person who wrote 
                        this book harm read the book and 
                        enacted the killing described to 
                        incriminate the writer.

                                    NICK
                               (after a long beat)
                        What if the writer did it?  What 
                        are we dealing with?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing with a devious, 
                        diabolical mind.  This book must 
                        have been written at least six 
                        months, maybe years before it was 
                        published.  That means the writer 
                        planned the crime, at least in the 
                        subconscious, back then.  The fact 
                        that the writer carried it out 
                        indicates psychopathic obsessive 
                        behavior in terms not only of the 
                        killing itself but in terms of 
                        applied advance defense mechanism.

                        Most times I can't tell shit from 
                        shinola, Doc.  What was all that 
                        you just said?

          Some grins, titters.

                                    BETH
                        She anticipates the book to be her 
                        best alibi.

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        Correct.

                                    BETH
                        She's going to say Do you think 
                        I'd be dumb enough to kill anyone 
                        in the exact way I've described in 
                        my book?  I wouldn't do that because 
                        I'd know I'd be a suspect.

          A long beat -- as they think about it.

                                    NICK
                        What if it's not the writer?  What 
                        if it's someone who read the book?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing then with someone 
                        so obsessed that he or she is 
                        willing to kill an irrelevant and 
                        innocent victim to place the blame 
                        on the person who wrote this book.  
                        We are talking about deep-seated, 
                        obsessional hatred; an utter lack 
                        of sense of proportion or 
                        perspective.

                                    GUS
                        We've got a top-of-the-line, once-
                        in-a-lifetime loony-tune either 
                        way you cut it -- that's what you're 
                        saying, right, Doc?

                                    DR. LAMOTT
                        You're dealing with someone very 
                        dangerous and very ill.

          INT. THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

          PROSECUTOR JOHN CORRIGAN, a big man in his 50's, with Captain 
          Talcott, Lt. Walker, Nick, and Gus.

          Corrigan is reading a file.  He gets up, yawns, goes to his 
          window, looks out.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        Come on, you know there's no case 
                        here.  There's no physical evidence -- 
                        okay, she doesn't have an alibi 
                        but there's no motive.  Her defense 
                        would just beat us to death with 
                        the copycat thing.  Anybody who 
                        read the book could have done it.

                               (after a beat)
                        We bring her in for questioning.

                                    TALCOTT
                        She's got enough money to burn 
                        this whole department down.

                                    LT. WALKER
                        She was the last person seen with 
                        the guy -- I'll take the 
                        responsibility.

                                    TALCOTT
                        It's yours.

                                    CORRIGAN
                        It won't do any good.  She'll come 
                        in with Lee Bailey and Mel Belli 
                        trailing behind her on a solid 
                        gold chain from Tiffanys.

                                    TALCOTT
                        Yes she will.

                               (after a beat)
                        No she won't.

          They look at him.

                        I don't think she's going to hide 
                        behind anybody.  I don't think 
                        she's going to hide at all.

                        I think you're as crazy as she

               MUSIC. TITLES.

               EXT. OCEAN -- NIGHT

               The darkness is actually water. A SEARCHLIGHT arcs across 
               heavy ocean swells. Half-a-dozen flashlights -- weaker beams -- 
               racing along what we can see is the deck of an aging FISHING 
               TRAWLER.

               FISHERMEN struggling with a gaff -- something in the water --

               A HUMAN CORPSE.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT

               THE BODY sprawled there. The Sailors all talking at once -- 
               three languages going -- brave chatter to mask the presence 
               of death --

                         before? --

                         -- he's dead, you think he cares? --

               THE BODY MOVES! -- convulsing -- coughing up sea water -- 
               the Sailors -- freaked -- jumping back -- standing there, as --

               THE MAN begins to breathe.

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- NIGHT

               A wreck. Too small for all the people in here right now -- 
               SAILORS sweeping off the table -- rough hands laying THE MAN 
               down --

               THE CAPTAIN -- brutal and impatient -- watching from the 
               door as --

               GIANCARLO tears through the clutter -- searching for a medical 
               kit buried in the shambles. GIANCARLO is sixty. A bloodshot 
               soul.

                                     GIANCARLO

                         some blankets -- get some blankets 
                         on him --

                         We pick him up? Okay, we have to 
                         pick him up. But that's as far as it

                         He needs a doctor.

                         Fuck that. He lives? He dies? I don't 
                         care. We've wasted two hours on this 
                         shit already. You do what you can, 
                         but we're not going back.
                              (pure steel now)
                         You understand me?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         Yes, sir.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (to the rest of them)
                         Let's get back to work!

               GIANCARLO watching them run out. Snagging a quick pull on a 
               pint of rum he's got stashed and --

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAWN -- TIME CUTS

               Transformed into a makeshift operating room. A light swings 
               overhead. THE MAN layed out across the table. Sounds -- groans -- 
               words -- snatches of them -- all in different languages.

               GIANCARLO playing doctor in a greasy kitchen apron. Cutting 
               away the clothes. Turning THE MAN on his side. Two bullet 
               wounds in the back. Probing them, judging them.

               Now -- GIANCARLO with a flashlight in his teeth -- TINK -- 
               TINK -- TINK -- bullet fragments falling into a washed-out 
               olive jar.

               Now -- something catching GIANCARLO'S EYE -- A SCAR ON THE 
               MAN'S HIP -- another fragment -- exacto knife cutting in -- 
               tweezers extracting A SMALL PLASTIC TUBE, not a bullet at 
               all, and as it comes free --

               THE MAN'S HAND SLAMS down onto GIANCARLO'S and we SMASH CUT 
               INTO A --

               FIRST PERSON POV -- we are staring up at --

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You're awake. Can you hear me?
                              (we're blinking --)
                         You've been shot. I'm trying to help 
                         you.
                              (we're trying to find 
                              our voice --)
                         You were in the water. You've been 
                         shot. It's okay now.

                                     THE MAN
                         Where am I?

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (switching to English)
                         You're American. I thought so. From 
                         your teeth -- the dental work --

                                     THE MAN
                         Where am I?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You're on a boat. A fishing boat. 
                         Italian flag. We're out of Vietri.
                              (he smiles)
                         It's the cold that saved you. The 
                         water. The wounds are clean. I'm not 
                         a doctor, but the wounds, it looks 
                         okay. It's clean.

                                     THE MAN
                         How did I get here?

                                     GIANCARLO
                         You we're lost at sea. They pulled 
                         you out.
                              (we say nothing)
                         Who are you?
                              (still nothing)
                         You were shot -- two bullets -- in 
                         the back. You understand me?
                              (we try to nod)
                         Who are you?

               Long dead pause.

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't know.

               EXT. OCEAN -- DAY

               The Trawler plows through heavy seas.

               INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAY

               GIANCARLO is hunched over a desk -- tweezers and flashlight -- 
               busy working at that strange plastic tube that came out of 
               THE MAN's hip.

               THE MAN is bandaged. He's sitting up, and it must hurt like 
               hell, but physical pain is not the thing troubling him right 
               now. He's staring around the room -- at his body -- at the 
               walls -- haunted --

                                     THE MAN
                         What if it doesn't come back?

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (still working that 
                              tube)
                         I told you. You need to rest.

               Silence. THE MAN can't rest. Too busy trying to make sense 
               of all this.

                                     THE MAN
                         I can read. I can read that sign on 
                         the door. I can count. I can talk...
                              (focusing now --)
                         What are you doing?

               GIANCARLO rummaging around -- finding a magnifying glass --

                                     THE MAN
                         What is that?

               INSERT -- MAGNIFIED POV -- a slip of plastic from the tube -- 
               written there -- 000-7-17-12-0-14-26.  GEMEINSCHAFT BANK, 
               ZURICH.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         It came from your hip. Under the 
                         skin.
                              (turning back --)
                         You have a bank in Zurich.
                              (waiting)
                         You remember Zurich?

                                     THE MAN
                         No.

               GIANCARLO staring at him now. Different suddenly. Suspicious.

                                     GIANCARLO
                         Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? 
                         I'm an engineer. Whatever this is, 
                         it's not for me to be involved, okay?

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't remember Zurich.

               GIANCARLO pulls his pint. Takes a hit.

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (offering the bottle --)
                         You drink rum?

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't know.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT

               THE MAN stands at the rail, staring out to sea. So lost. He 
               turns to head inside -- there, a surfcasting rod propped 
               against a locker.

               THE MAN picks up the rod -- flips the bail -- traps the line -- 
               now he's casting far out into the darkness. And for the first 
               time, he smiles.

               INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT

               A ratty old espresso machine. THE MAN standing there, staring 
               at the thing like it's a test. Then his hands begin to move -- 
               trying to pack a grind -- trying to fit it in -- turning on 
               the steam and --

               The whole thing explodes.

               EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- DAY

               THE MAN alone doing chin-ups on the deck rail. He's still 
               bandaged and the wounds must hurt like hell, but he's pushing 
               himself. Using the pain -- bathing in it -- maybe even hoping 
               that it will hold some answer for him.

               INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT

               A chess board. Wooden pieces jumbled in a box. THE MAN 
               hesitates -- takes a black knight from the box -- lingers 
               for a moment -- and then places it on the board. He's off 
               and running. He knows this. Placing pieces faster and faster -- 
               still setting it up, as we --

               INT. FISHING BOAT HEAD -- NIGHT

               One of the ugliest bathrooms on the planet. THE MAN standing 
               before a pitted, tarnished, cataract of a mirror. Staring at 
               himself.

               And then he speaks.

                                     THE MAN
                              (in perfect French)
                         I don't know who I am. Do you know 
                         who I am? Do have any idea who I am?

               And then he stops. Blinks. Wipes away the perspiration just 
               beading on his forehead.

                                     THE MAN
                              (in perfect Dutch)
                         Tell me who I am. If you know who I 
                         am, please stop fucking around and 
                         tell me.

               No answer. Just that face. His face. Who am I?

               And what else is inside there?

               EXT. FISHING BOAT -- DAY

               SAILORS hauling in the nets. THE MAN -- still bandaged, but 
               healing -- working beside them. Earning his keep. Getting 
               healthy.

               EXT. ITALIAN COASTLINE -- DAWN

               A small, colorful fishing village. The trawler motoring in.

               INT. THE FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- SAME TIME

               THE MAN buttoning up borrowed clothes. GIANCARLO pulling 
               some cash from his pocket --

                                     GIANCARLO
                              (offering the money)
                         It's not much, but it should get you 
                         to Switzerland.

                                     THE MAN
                         I won't forget this.

               GIANCARLO gives him a look. Shakes his head, and --

               INT. POKEY ITALIAN TRAIN STATION -- DAY

               The ticket window. THE MAN and a TICKET AGENT.

                                     TICKET AGENT
                         Una sola via?

                                     THE MAN
                         Si. One way. Una sola via.

               EXT. TGV -- DAY

               A HELICOPTER SHOT -- a bullet train speeds through snow- 
               capped Alps. We move in on a window -- and staring out is...

               INT. TGV TRAIN -- DAY

               ...THE MAN. People all around him -- families -- businessmen -- 
               normal people going about their lives. THE MAN turns back to 
               the window, but he's not watching the scenery -- he's looking 
               at his reflection. So lost. His face suddenly plunged into 
               darkness as the train bombs into a tunnel...

               EXT. TRAIN -- NIGHT

               ...and out of the darkness into night and the HELICOPTER 
               SHOT, as the train races toward ZURICH.

               INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               A VIDEO MONITOR -- FULL FRAME -- meet WOMBOSI. He's an African 
               ex-dictator, think Idi Amin crossed with Mobutu. He's in 
               some sort of throne room. And he's angry. Bodyguards and a 
               translator hovering nervously around him. What this is, is 
               NEWS FOOTAGE -- an interview conducted by a German TV station.

                                     WOMBOSI
                              (he speaks english)
                         ...no, no, no -- the time is not 
                         right, my enemies are too strong. 
                         I'm telling you to wait for this, 
                         you understand? I'm telling you this, 
                         and I'm making a warning to all those 
                         peoples out there that think that my 
                         powers have become so weak that they 
                         can play with me as they wish. You 
                         will see -- I will tell you when the 
                         evidence is clear. Then you will 
                         have a story. My old friends will 
                         hear about themselves.
                              (stopping, freezing 
                              on that image, and --)

               MARSHALL, a CIA bigwig has the remote control. And the floor.

                                     MARSHALL
                         That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in 
                         Paris the day before yesterday. I'm 
                         sure most of you have a passing 
                         knowledge of Mr. Wombosi. Some of 
                         you on the African desks have worked 
                         with him over the years. Some of you 
                         very closely...

               TWELVE CIA MANDARINS sitting around the table like kids in 
               detention. We will tour the faces as MARSHALL continues, but 
               the guy we're interested in is named WARD ABBOTT. Picture a 
               sawier, slicker John Poindexter.

                                     MARSHALL
                         ...He was an irritation before he 
                         took power. He was a problem when he 
                         was in power. And he's been a disaster 
                         for us in exile.
                              (the tape --)
                         Wombosi likes to send us messages 
                         through the European media. This is 
                         an interview we pulled down from a 
                         local German television station in 
                         Dresden. We've been getting these 
                         little broadsides every couple of 
                         months. He knows this -- he knows 
                         that -- he's writing a book about 
                         the Agency's history in Africa -- 
                         he's going to name names. It's 
                         basically a shakedown...

               ABBOTT'S FACE says this is news to him. HIS HANDS suggest 
               otherwise.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This interview -- and I'll make the 
                         tape available for anyone who wants 
                         it -- he goes on to claim that he 
                         has just survived an assassination 
                         attempt. He says it's us. He says 
                         he's got proof.
                              (beat)
                         The overwhelming negative 
                         ramifications of this should be 
                         obvious.
                              (hard and dry)
                         The Director wants to know if there 
                         is any possible shred of truth in 
                         this accusation.

               Long pause. No hands go up.

               INT. ZURICH TRAIN STATION -- NIGHT

               THE MAN wandering through the terminal. Passing A PIZZA PLACE 
               closing up for the night.

               THE MAN checks his funds. Just enough for one cold slice.

               EXT. ZURICH STREETS -- NIGHT

               THE MAN walking aimlessly.

               EXT. ZURICH PARK -- NIGHT

               THE MAN trying to get comfortable on a bench. It's chilly 
               but this will have to do until morning.

               Just settling in, when --

                                     ZURICH COP #1 (O.S.)
                              (authority German)
                         Can't you read the signs?

               THE MAN turns. TWO ZURICH COPS coming toward him.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                         On your feet. Let's go. Right now.

               THE MAN makes his feet. They're on top of him now.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                         The park is closed. There's no 
                         sleeping in the park.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                         Let's see some identification.

               THE MAN not sure what to do. Eyes moving. Mouth shut.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                         Come on. Your papers. Let's go.

                                     THE MAN
                         I've lost them. I've...
                              (German now)
                         My papers. They are lost.

                                     ZURICH COP #1
                              (not sympathetic)
                         Okay. Let's go. Put your hands up.

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                              (pulling his nightstick)
                          -- come on -- hands up -- up --

               THE MAN raising his hand slowly -- ZURICH COP #1 reaching up 
               to pat him down --

                                     THE MAN
                         -- look, I'm just trying to sleep 
                         okay? --
                              (German again)
                          -- I just need to sleep --

               ZURICH COP #2 has heard enough -- giving a sharp poke with 
               the nightstick -- into THE MAN's back -- and that's the last 
               thing he'll remember because --

               THE MAN is in motion.

               A single turn -- spinning -- catching COP #2 completely off 
               guard -- the heel of his hand driving up into the guy's throat 
               and --

               COP #1 -- behind him -- trying to reach for his pistol, but 
               THE MAN -- still turning -- all his weight moving in a single 
               fluid attack -- a sweeping kick and --

               COP #1 -- he's falling -- catching the bench -- trying to 
               fight back but -- THE MAN -- like a machine -- just 
               unbelievably fast -- three jackhammer punches -- down-down- 
               down and -- COP #1 -- head slammed into the bench -- blood 
               spraying from his nose -- he's out cold and --

               COP #2 -- writhing on the ground -- gasping for air -- 
               struggling with his holster -- THE MAN -- his foot -- down -- 
               like a vise -- onto COP #2's arm -- shattering the bone -- 
               COP #2 starting to scream, and then silenced because --

               THE MAN -- he's got the pistol -- so fucking fast -- he's 
               got it right up against COP #2's forehead -- right on the 
               edge of pulling the trigger -- he is, he's gonna shoot him --

                                     ZURICH COP #2
                              (gasping, pleading)
                         -- no -- please God no -- please 
                         don't -- please no -- my Go

               -- stopping as --

               THE MAN slams the gun against his temple and --

               This fight is over.

               THE MAN standing there. In the silence. Two unconscious cops 
               at his feet. Blood on his pants. What just happened? How did 
               he do this? And there's THE GUN in his hand. And God, it 
               just feels so natural -- checking it -- stripping it down -- 
               holding it -- aiming it -- like this is something he's done 
               a million times before...

               This is something he definitely knows how to do.

               And then he stops cold. Throwing down the gun. Running off 
               into the darkness --

               INT. TREADSTONE -- DAY

               A deep, inner office. An ops office. Operations. Unlabeled 
               and anonymous. A backwater project center hidden deep within 
               the Langley facility. Utilitarian. Several rooms linked like 
               a suite.

               Small staff. SEVERAL TECHNICIANS. One or two for 
               communications. A couple for research. People are at their 
               posts. And it's all quiet. But they are busy. Quietly urgent. 
               This is a place under siege.

               ZORN is the number two here. Brilliant bloodless lapdog. 
               He's coming through the suite. Coming through quickly. Heading 
               toward the boss's little office at the back --

               TED CONKLIN. Ivy League Ollie North. Buttoned down. Square 
               jaw. Everything tucked away. But there's tension in the air. 
               Work on the desk. Cot in the corner.

                                     CONKLIN
                              (looking up)
                         What?

                                     ZORN
                         Abbott wants to talk.

                                     CONKLIN
                         Tell him we're busy.

                                     ZORN
                         I tried.

               INT. CIA COMMISSARY -- NIGHT

               ABBOTT with coffee. CONKLIN not lingering.

                                     ABBOTT
                         Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It 
                         looks like rain and I don't have a 
                         thing to wear.

                                     CONKLIN
                         I don't know what we're talking about.

                                     ABBOTT
                         We're talking about Marseille. We're 
                         talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And 
                         I'm asking you if this abortion in 
                         Marseille has anything to do with 
                         Treadstone.
                              (silence)
                         Was this Treadstone?

                                     CONKLIN
                         You're asking me a direct question?

                                     ABBOTT
                         Yes.

                                     CONKLIN
                         I thought you were never going to do 
                         that.

               Silence. Pressure drop.

                                     ABBOTT
                         They're putting together an agency 
                         oversight committee. They're going 
                         to look through everyone's budgets. 
                         Treadstone is a rather sizable line 
                         item in my ledger.
                              (beat)
                         What am I going to do about that?

                                     CONKLIN
                         You'd want to make that go away. 
                         You'd want to remind them that 
                         Treadstone is a training organization. 
                         That it's all theoretical. You'd 
                         want to sign off on that.

                                     ABBOTT
                         And what if I couldn't do that?

                                     CONKLIN
                         Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. 
                         And you'd have to explain how you 
                         let me get this far.
                              (silence)
                         Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, 
                         does it?
                              (Abbott staring)
                         We'll clean up the field. You clean 
                         up your budgets.

               EXT. ZURICH -- DAY

               Morning in the financial district. Upscale. Uptight.

               GEMEINSCHAFT BANK just one of many elegant fortresses on 
               this street. Everything just now opening for business. TWO 
               GUARDS unlocking the front door and --

               THE MAN across the street. Tucked in the shadows. Checking 
               for cops and trouble. Looks clear. He's walking and --

               INT. BANK RECEPTION AREA -- DAY

               Ornate, formidable and tech at the same time.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Can I help you?

               THE MAN standing before her. Looking very out of place.

                                     THE MAN
                         I'm here about a numbered account.

               THE RECEPTIONIST nods. Pulls a pen and bank card.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                              (instant English)
                         If you'll just enter your account 
                         number here I'll direct you to the 
                         appropriate officer.

               THE MAN takes the pen, as we --

               INT. BANK SECURITY CHECKPOINT -- DAY

               A BIO-METRIC SCANNER. A piece of ultra-tech amidst the 
               Baroque. TWO SERIOUS BANK GUARDS manning the equipment.

               THE MAN standing there, staring down at this machine. 
               Something ominously decisive about this. What if it's him? 
               What if it's not?

                                     BANK GUARD #1
                         They've been waiting your hand, sir...

               THE MAN focuses. Here we go -- BANK GUARD #2 guiding his 
               open palm onto the mirrored scanning surface.

               THE MAN catching his reflection for a moment before a wave 
               of white light passes beneath his hand and now --

               INT. BANK HALLWAY -- DAY

               THE MAN being led by A THIRD GUARD to a special elevator.

               INT. DEEPER INSIDE THE BANK -- DAY

               Elevator doors open. THE MAN steps out. MR. APFEL -- anal 
               Zurich banker -- waiting there.

                                     APFEL
                         Good morning, sir. I assume you're 
                         here about your box.

                                     THE MAN
                         ...yes...
                              (what now?)
                         The box.

               APFEL nods. Gestures down the corridor --

               INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT VIEWING ROOM -- DAY

               Sterile and kind of odd. But total privacy. THE MAN sitting 
               there, as A DEPOSIT GUARD places a large SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX 
               before him. THE GUARD leaves the room. Closing the door behind 
               him.

               THE MAN is alone. And there it is, right in front of him. 
               This is it. Here are the answers. He lifts the lid.

               THE BOX. There's a shallow tray on top. In this tray: a beat-
               up passport in the name of Jason Bourne. A French driver's 
               license with a Parisian address. Credit cards for Jason 
               Bourne.

               THE MAN. Holding these objects close -- as if by holding 
               them he might absorb their essence. Forcing himself to 
               believe. This is him. His picture. There it is. He's Jason 
               Bourne.

                                     BOURNE
                         My name is Jason Bourne.
                              (sounds good)
                         Hi, I'm Jason. Jason Bourne. Jason 
                         Bourne, nice to meet you.

               BACK TO -- THE BOX -- the shallow tray on top. There's 
               Kleenex. Several sets of contact lenses. A knife. A comb. 
               Three sticks of gum. A ring. A pair of sunglasses. A Rolex.

               BOURNE setting these things aside.  Lifting the top tray.  
               Staring into THE DEEP BOTTOM TRAY and --

               First of all...

               MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds. 
               Lots of them. Close to a million dollars. There's A GUN. A 
               very good gun. Several clips of ammo. And...

               FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Crisp. Brand new. All with 
               his photo inside. Five different names. Three different 
               Countries. Each one of these pristine passports clipped to a 
               piece of card stock that says:

               NAME: 
               NATIONALITY: 
               PLACE OF ISSUE: 
               SIGNATURE SAMPLE:

               And a bar code. 
               Two Dutch passports. A French. A South African. A Belgian.

               And...

               There's one piece of card stock still with the paper clip in 
               place. And no passport. This card reads:

               NAME: John Michael Kane 
               NATIONALITY: U.S.A. 
               PLACE OF ISSUE: Paris, France 
               There's a signature sample. 
               And a bar code. But no passport. This one is missing.

               BOURNE sitting there. Trying to push his confusion away.

                                     BOURNE
                         Bourne. My name is Jason Bourne. I 
                         live at 121, Rue de la Jardin, Paris.

               But there's something hollow about this. He came looking for 
               one identity and now he's faced with six. The money... The 
               gun...

               Suddenly, it's all fucked up.

1 EXT. MERCEDES WINDSHIELD -- DUSK 1

It's raining...

Light strobes across the wet glass at a rhythmic pace...

Suddenly -- through the window a face -- JASON BOURNE --
riding in the backseat -- his gaze fixed.


A1 INT. MERCEDES -- NIGHT A1

On his knee -- a syringe and a gun --

The eyes of the driver, JARDA, watching --

BOURNE'S POV -- the passenger -- back of his HEAD -- cell
phone rings -- the HEAD turns -- it's CONKLIN --

BOURNE returns his stare...

CUT TO --


2 INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM -- NIGHT 2

BOURNE'S EYES OPEN! -- panicked -- gasping -- trying to
stay quiet -- MARIE sleeps.


A2 INT. COTTAGE LIVING AREA/BATHROOM -- NIGHT A2

BOURNE moving for the medicine cabinet. Digs through the
medicine cabinet. Downs something specific.

3 INT./EXT. COTTAGE LIVING ROOM/VERANDA -- NIGHT
One minute later. BOURNE moves out onto the veranda.

MARIE pads in. Watching him for a moment. Concerned.
Clearly it's not the first time this has happened.

The y both loo k differe nt than last we saw them; his hair is
lon ger. She' s a blond e. Hippie trav elers. Th eir cottage
is humble but sweet. The bedroom ope ns to a be ach and a
tow n just dow n the hil l. CLUB MUSIC from some all night
rav e wafting in from t he far distance .

MARIE
Where were you, Jason?

BOURNE
In the car. Conklin up front.

2.


MARIE
I'll get the book.

BOURNE
No. There's nothing new.

MARIE
You're sure?
(he nods)
We should still -- we should write it
down.

BOURNE
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook -- *

MARIE
-- it hasn't been two years -- *

BOURNE
-- it's alwa ys bad and it's never *
anything but bits and piece s anyway! *
(she's gone quiet) *
You ever thi nk that maybe i t's just *
making it wo rse? You don't wonder that? *

She lays her hands on his shoulders, steadies him.

MARIE
We write them down because sooner or *
later you're going to remember something *
good. *

BOURNE
(softens)
I do remember something good. All the
time. I remember you.

She smiles. Kisses him. Leads him back in.

4 INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM -- NIGHT
MARIE getting BOURNE into the bed. Turning down the light.
Getting him settled. Waiting for that pill to kick in.
What would he do without her?

BOURNE
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?

MARIE
I worry when you get like this.

3.


BOURNE
It's just a nightmare.

MARIE
I don't mean that. I worry when you try
to ignore it.

He hesitates. But that gets him. He knows she's right.
And with that opening, he's letting go. Resistance
fol ding. Almost childlike. She's gathering him in.
He' s letting her do it...

MARIE (CONT'D)
Sleep. Sleep now.

BOURNE
I should be better by now.

MARIE
You are better. And I think it's not
memories at all. It's just a dream you
keep having over and over.

BOURNE
But it ends up the same.

MARIE
One day it will be different. It just
takes time.
(beat)
We'll make new memories. You and me.

Silence. She strokes his face. He gives in to her
tenderness. He's fading. Two waifs in the dark.

5 EXT. BEACH -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY
BOU RNE running in the sun. A punishing pace along the
san d. Moving strong. Effortless. Deep into it. Focused.
The stunning conjunction of sun and scenery are lost on
him .


6 EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY 6

A busy market town. Fishing town. Hippie town. Lots of
young Western faces. Rundown and happening at the same
time.

MARIE shopping. Filling a bag with local produce.

4.


7 EXT. ROAD -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY 7

BOURNE still running, leaving the beach behind.


8 INT. COTTAGE KITCHEN -- DAY 8

MARIE back from the market, putting the groceries away.
Almost done, when she stops for a moment --

A PHOTOGRAPH. There on the windowsill. A snapshot. Jason
and Marie on a beach. Her arms around him. As if she were
the protector. Big smiles. Young. Alive. In love.

MARIE smiles.


9 EXT. MAIN STREET -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY 9

Funky busy. Colonial facades in vivid, sub-continental
technicolor. Loud morning traffic.

CAMERA FINDS

BOURNE coming out of a store with a big bottle of water.
He's just finished his run. Standing there, chugging away,
checking the scene, when something catches his eye --

HIS POV

THE STREET. A SILVER CAR -- something newish -- pulling
down the block -- can't quite see who's driving, but --

BACK TO

BOURNE watching this silver car. So serious he's casual.
Nobody passing would notice, but we do: He's on alert.
MOVING WITH HIM AS
BOURNE follows THE SILVER CAR on foot -- natural --
cruising the BUSY SIDEWALK -- blending into the mix --
chugging on that water bottle and --

UP AHEAD

THE SILVER CAR making the corner and turning now --

BACK TO
BOURNE slowing as he reaches the corner --

HIS POV

THE SILVER CA R has par ked. There's a GUY -- well-dressed --
cas ual -- phy sical -- sunglasses -- call him KIRILL -- he's
out of the ca r and hea ding across the street toward a
bui lding ther e. A TEL EGRAPH OFFICE.

BACK TO

BOURNE checking his watch. The car. The guy. Perimeter.


10 INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE/GOA -- DAY 10 *

MR. MOHAN at his desk. He's a crisp, proper man of fifty.
He's just been handed something --

A PHOTOGRAPH OF MARIE -- an old passport picture.

MR. MOHAN
And your question, sir?

KIRILL across the desk.

KIRILL
She's my sister. There's been a
death in the family. This is the
last place we know she called from.


11 INT. COTTAGE -- DAY 11

A NOTE ON THE TABLE: ""I'M AT THE BEACH""

BOURNE has just come in -- just read the note -- balling it
quickly. In fact, everything is quickly now, because --

BOURNE is bailing.
Fast. Calm. Methodical. Some exfil procedure that he's
honed and choreographed. Packing like a machine --

RAPID TIME CUTS
-- BACKPACKS thrown open on the bed. -- HOUSE CASH pulled
from a lamp base. -- CREDIT CARDS taped under the counter.


12 EXT. MAIN STREET/BANK GOA/BEACH TOWN -- DAY 12

KIRILL coming out of the bank. Mission accomplished.
Heading back to the SILVER CAR. Getting in and --

6.


13 INT. SILVER CAR -- DAY (CONT) 13

He's cool. Putting the car into gear, he makes a slow pass *
through the marketplace. Eyes everywhere. *


14 DELETED 14 *


15 INT. COTTAGE -- DAY 15

BOURNE -- done -- the place is stripped -- pulling on the
backpacks -- glancing around -- one last thing -- shit, he
almost missed it --

THE PHOTOGRAPH -- the one of he and Marie on the beach --
the one we saw her looking at earlier -- there it is on the
windowsill -- jamming it into his pocket and --

A burly JEEP comes roaring up. BOURNE spots the SILVER *
CAR, parks at the other end -- takes off towards the beach. *

7.


19 EXT. BEACH -- GOA -- DAY 19 *

KIRILL methodically making his way up the beach -- *
checking every blue tent -- every towel. *


20 EXT. BEACH -- GOA -- DAY 20 *

BOURNE coming up the beach the opposite way -- one eye on *
KIRILL, one eye on MARIE. *

He arrives just as KIRILL looks up and sees them a *
hundred yards away -- a hard stare between them -- BOURNE *
bends down -- *

BOURNE
We gotta go, Marie. We gotta go, now.

Fro m the tone of his voice, she knows it's serious. *
Mar ie grabs h er bag. A quick goodbye to the friends. *
The y hurry of f. BOURNE uses the sunbathers as cover. *
KIR ILL retrea ts. *


21 EXT. BEACH/PARKING LOT -- GOA -- DAY 21 *

They reach the JEEP -- she knows the drill -- bag tossed in *
the back -- even as the Jeep pulls away and -- *


22 INT. JEEP -- DAY (CONT) 22

BOURNE driving. MARIE beside him --

BOURNE
We're blown.

She hesitates. One minute ago everything was fine.

MARIE
No... How?

BOURNE
The Telegraph office.

MARIE
But we were so careful.

BOURNE
We pushed it. We got lazy. *

8.


23 EXT. BEACH/PARKING LOT -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY 23 *

KIRILL already back at the SILVER CAR -- following them *
out onto the MAIN STREET -- blocked by the local traffic -- *
pulling a HUGE AUTOMATIC PISTOL out from his travel bag.


24 EXT. BEACHTOWN ALLEY/OFF MAIN STREET -- DAY 24

THE JEEP pulling down this narrow little passageway and --

BOURNE'S WINDSHIELD POV *

MAIN STREET packed with traffic and --

BACK TO

BOURNE not liking this. Eyes all over -- trying to decide.

MARIE
But you're sure?

BOURNE
He was at the campground yesterday.

MARIE
So... *

BOURNE
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and *
hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?

Trying to decide whether to pull out or back up --

MARIE
That's crazy. *

BOURNE
No. Not thi s. This is real. *
(sudde nly) *
And he's rig ht there... *
(throw ing the car into
rever se)

MARIE

BOURNE
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- *
silver -- *

25 INT. HYUNDAI -- DAY (CONT) 25 *

KIRILL trapped in some Main Street gridlock. Glancing back
for a way out -- freezing suddenly, because there --

HIS POV -- THE JEEP -- THE ALLEY -- right there -- twenty
yards back -- a good look at BOURNE and MARIE -- as they
disappear and --


26 EXT. ALLEYWAY -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY (CONT) 26

THE JEEP backing up the way it came -- BLOWING ITS HORN
because an OLD VAN pulls in and blocks him from behind --


27 INT. JEEP -- DAY (CONT) 27

BOURNE leaning on THE HORN -- shit, now they've got to
wait!

MARIE *
...but you're not -- you're not sure... *

BOURNE *
We can't wait to be sure. *

MARIE *
I don't want to move again...I like it *
here. *

BOURNE *
Loo k, we clear out, we get to the shack, *
we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll *
com e back. I'll check it out. But right *
now we can't -- *

MARIE *
-- where's left to go? -- *

BOURNE *
-- there's places -- we can't afford to *
be wrong! *


28 INT. HYUNDAI -- DAY (CONT) 28

KIR ILL. Calm. Possessed of a familiar tactical patience.
He can't get the Hyundai to the alley from where he is and *
it doesn't make sense to go on foot. He checks his
rea rview.

10.


Fuck it -- there's an opening ahead and he's taking it -- *
even though it's away from them -- he'll find another way -- *


29 EXT. ALLEYWAY -- GOA/BEACHTOWN -- DAY -- (CONT) 29

BOURNE sees the HYUNDAI move forward into traffic. THE OLD *
VAN is still blocking them from behind -- *

BOURNE *
You drive. *

MARIE *
What? *

BOURNE *
(already squeezing over) *
Switch! You drive! *

MARIE *
-- where? -- *

BOURNE *
-- make the left -- toward the bridge -- *

MARIE scrambling over the seat. BOURNE, eyes everywhere, *
checks his watch. *

THE JEEP squirts back on the main street and --


30 INT. JEEP -- DAY -- CONT 30

MARIE at the wheel -- adrenaline pumping -- clear running
for thirty yards ahead and --

MARIE skidding them into the right turn -- clipping another
vehicle -- MIRROR SHATTERING! -- speeding up.

BOURNE scanning behind them -- MARIE moving out to pass --
veering back! -- an ONCOMING BUS -- just in time and --
MARIE
-- Jesus! --
(glancing over)
-- is he back there? --

BOURNE
-- not yet --

MARIE
-- it's just him? --

11.


BOURNE
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think
he was ready --

MARIE
-- hang on --

MARIE bearing down -- pulling out -- gives him a quick
smile -- BOURNE knowing he's got a good one here -- *


31 INT. HYUNDAI -- DAY/SUNSET 31 *

KIRILL stopping short on a rise. Bit of a view from here. *
Gets half out the car to look. *

BELOW -- the JEEP headed for A BRIDGE. He's gonna lose *
them. KIRILL'S mind racing. Grabs duffle from the back, *
abandons car. *


32 INT. JEEP -- BRIDGE -- DAY/SUNSET 32

MARIE driving. BOURNE preps his pistol. Eye out for *
KIRILL. *

BOURNE *
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet *
you there in an hour. *

MARIE *
(concerned) *
Where are you going? *

BOURNE *
I'm going to bail on the other side and *
wait. This bridge is the only way he can *
follow. *

MARIE *
What if it's not who you think it is? *

BOURNE *
If he crosses the bridge, it is. *

MARIE *
There must be another way! *

BOURNE *
I warned them, Marie. I told them to *
leave us alone. *

12.


MARIE *
Jason, please don't do this...it won't *
ever be over like this. *

BOURNE *
There's no choice. *

HER POV

The old CONCRETE BRIDGE ahead. Almost there.


33 EXT. LOW WALL -- DAY/SUNSET 33

KIRILL slams into it. Quick, precise grabs into the bag.
Only a moment and he's got a SNIPER RIFLE.


A34 INT. JEEP -- BRIDGE -- DAY A34

BOURNE -- pistol in hand -- spare clip in the other -- *
checks his watch. *

BOURNE *
At the end make the left, when I roll out *
do not slow down. *

MARIE nods, got it. After a beat... *

MARIE *
I love you, too. *

BOURNE *
Tell me later. *

MARIE looks ahead.

B34
B34 EXT. LOW WALL -- DAY
KIRILL. Eye to the scope. *

SNIPER SCOPE POV

There! The JEEP rumbling across the bridge. No clear
target, just the back of the full DRIVER'S SIDE HEADREST.

KIRILL'S FINGER

Squeezing. Firing.

13.


34 EXT. WOODEN BRIDGE -- DAY (CONT) 34

The JEEP jerking.

FRONT FENDER tearing into and along the guard rail --
cement shards fill the air --

BOURNE reaching for the wheel -- Too late!

As the JEEP finally crashes through the flimsy guardrail --

Plummets -- splashes hard -- begins to sink out of sight.


35 EXT. LOW WALL -- DAY (CONT) 35

KIR ILL lowers the scop e, takes a quick look around. He's
bas ically gon e unnotic ed in this little nook with his
sil enced rifl e. But p eople are already rushing toward the
bri dge. Then ... there !

An OLD WOMAN looking directly at KIRILL from a doorway.
Not quite sure what. But an old Indian woman in Goa? So
what.

KIRILL drills her with a look. As she sinks back inside --


36 INT. JEEP -- SINKING IN THE RIVER -- DAY/SUNSET 36

Swallowed up. BOURNE and MARIE gone. *


37 EXT. LOW WALL -- SUNSET 37

KIRILL scans the surface of the river under the bridge.
Waiting.

38
38 EXT. RIVER BOTTOM -- DAY
Mud plumes as the JEEP settles. BOURNE reaches over to *
MARIE, tries to urge her out. *


39 EXT. LOW WALL -- DAY 39

KIRILL with a killer's patience, waiting, almost done.

SCOPE POV
The surface of the water. Unbroken.

14.


KIRILL

Scans his perimeter. There's the old woman again. But
more people with her. People coming out of the woodwork.

KIRILL checks the surface one last time. Nothing.

He breaks down the rifle in moments -- goes. *


40 EXT. JEEP -- RIVER BOTTOM -- DAY 40

BOURNE -- up into an air pocket held by the jeep's canvas
top. A big gulp of air --

And he's back to MARIE. Frantic. Trying to unclip her *
seatbelt. Pull her out. But it's all jammed up. *


41 EXT. KIRILL -- BY THE SILVER CAR 41

Bag chucked in the back. All he has left is the scope. *
One last look to the unbroken surface. Then it's time to
go. KIRILL -- drifting away -- disappears.


42 EXT. JEEP -- RIVER BOTTOM -- DAY 42

The red halo growing bigger. BLOOD. *

BOURNE pauses. MARIE'S face is blank. She's dead. *

BOURNE finally pulling back. Realizing this is *
goodbye... *

GLOVED HANDS quickly pass over racks of gear and wiring and

They carefully place an EXPLOSIVE DEVICE -- no bigger than
a pack of cigarettes -- onto the main riser...

    BOURNE is badly wounded -- shot through the shoulder --
    bruises and broken bones from the final car chase in

    With a GROAN, he lifts himself up, staggers across a park
    toward a PHARMACY...

       Professor, Jarda, the blonde guy in Paris, Mr. And Mrs.

                   turn around slowly!

       BOURNE snaps out of it, doesn't move. POLICEMAN #1 (older)
       approaches him. When BOURNE doesn't respond to his
       questions, the POLICEMAN starts forward. BOURNE turns and
       in one motion grabs his gun from the sink and disables the
       POLICEMAN.

       BOURNE freezes POLICEMAN #2 with his gun and a look.

                             BOURNE

     Director, CIA.


8C   INT. KRAMER'S OFFICE -- DAY                                  8C

     Kramer listens to a recording with Landy and Cronin. There
     are unhung pictures and a few other items that indicate he
     has just moved into this job.

                                                          4


Two other senior CIA officials sit in on the meeting.
Kramer looks at a file on Bourne and Abbott.

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          So we got in the way?   Is that
          why Neski died? Is that why you
          killed Marie?

Kramer glances at a photo of Marie in the file.

                    ABBOTT (V.O.)
          You killed Marie the minute you
          climbed into her car.   The
          minute you entered her life she
          was dead!

Kramer looks at Abbott's official photo.

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          I told you people to leave me
          alone! I fell off the grid. I
          was half way around the world.

                    ABBOTT (V.O.)
          There's no place it won't catch
          up to you. It's how every story
          ends. It's what you are, Jason.
          A killer! You always will be.

THUMP!

                    CRONIN
          We think that's Bourne hitting
          him on the head and then--

He makes a gun with his hand, i.e. Bourne putting his gun
to Abbott's head.

                       ABBOTT (V.O.)
          Go ahead!     Go on! Do it!

                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          She wouldn't want me to. That's
          the only reason your alive.

The tape clicks off.

                    KRAMER
          Who's ""she?""

CRONIN puts a picture of MARIE in front of KRAMER.

                    LANDY
          His girlfriend, Marie. She was
          killed in India three weeks ago.

Kramer looks down at another image.     Abbott dead after his
suicide.

                                                        5


                    KRAMER
          A dirty section chief in league
          with a corrupt Russian
          Billionaire commits suicide when
          confronted by Jason Bourne. You
          couldn't make this stuff up.
              (holds up the photo of
               Abbot dead)
          You watched this happen?

Landy nods.   Kramer shakes his head in disgust at the whole
situation.

                    KRAMER
          Bourne's last confirmed location
          is Moscow, three days ago?

                       LANDY
          Right.

                    KRAMER
          So what does he do now?

                    LANDY
          I think he's looking for
          something he hasn't found.

                       KRAMER
          Like what?     What's he after?

                     LANDY
          I'm not sure. Maybe he hasn't
          gotten his memory back yet.  Not
          all of it.

A look from Kramer...

                    KRAMER
          Pam, what I need to know is, what
          kind of a threat is he to us?

                    LANDY
          If he just wanted to hurt us he
          could have sent this tape to CNN.

                    KRAMER
          Maybe he still will. Maybe he
          gave it to you because he wants
          to throw you in the opposite
          direction of his real plan. I
          don't know. I just know my
          number one rule is ""the only way
          to stay safe is to assume the
          worst.""   As far as I'm concerned
          Bourne is a serious threat until
          proven otherwise.

       ROSS interviews DANIELS, a TAPE RECORDER on the table
       between them. ROSS shows DANIELS some of the evidence he's
       assembled...WANTED POSTERS of JASON BOURNE.

                                ROSS
                         (with poster)
                     ...This one's three years ago --
                     had half of Interpol after him --
                     disappeared...Turned up in Naples
                     -- Berlin -- Moscow --
                     disappeared again...
                         (Daniels says nothing)
                     The girl he was on he run with --
                     Marie Kreutz -- she turned up
                     dead halfway around the world,
                     from a sniper's bullet...
                         (beat)
                     What connects the dots? Is it
                     Treadstone?

                               DANIELS
                     Turn off that tape recorder.

24     INT. DAY. MARTIN'S APARTMENT -- PARIS                       24

       The charm of old Paris captured in the workings of an
       elevator operating in a wrought-iron shaft...

                                                          7


A WORK TABLE, covered with sheet music, music paper,
pencils. And, sitting on the upright piano against the
wall, a framed PHOTO of MARIE...

A KNOCK on a door beautifully, heavily lacquered with
centuries of paint...

MARTIN KREUTZ, late 20s, opens the door and finds BOURNE. A
long look between them -- like two lost brothers who
recognize each other -- each has been waiting for this
moment for a long time.


INT. CONTINUOUS. MARTIN'S APARTMENT

Martin looks out the window.

                    MARTIN
          Where is my sister?

                    BOURNE
          She's dead. She was killed.

                    MARTIN
          I knew it was going to end this
          way. It was always going to end
          this way...

                    BOURNE
          I didn't believe that.

                    MARTIN
          Why did she die?

                    BOURNE
          She was shot. A man came for me.

                    MARTIN
          And then you killed him.

Bourne nods.

                      MARTIN
          Now what?

                    BOURNE
          Someone started all this...and
          I'm going to find them.

Bourne looks at him for a beat and leaves.


EXT. SUBWAY -- DAY

Bourne climbs the stairs.

Bourne rounds a corner and stops, sees a bodyguard at a
door up the street hail a car then go back inside.

                                                            8


     Bourne walks up to the door, the bodyguard comes out again.
     Bourne knocks him aside. Grabs the man behind him,
     ELLATRACHE.

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                Who started Treadstone?

     The bodyguard comes back, gun out--

                           ELLATRACHE
                    (in French, to
                      bodyguard)
                It's OK!
                    (in French, to Bourne)
                They're still looking for you.
                You are taking a big risk coming
                here.

     Bourne shoves him against the wall, hard.

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                Just tell me what I want to know!

                          ELLATRACHE
                    (in French)
                I just provided them weapons.    I
                don't know who started--

                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                You know something.   Tell me
                where to start looking.

                          ELLATRACHE
                    (in French)
                There's a journalist in London.
                Simon Ross. He seems to know a
                lot about you.   He has a source
                inside the program. Someone
                there from the beginning. What
                should I tell them if they
                contact me?

                          BOURNE
                    (in English)
                They give me the name I want, or
                I burn their entire house down to
                get it.


16   EXT.   DAY. HEATHROW AIRPORT -- LONDON                     16

     ROSS hurries to catch a TAXI as he talks on his cell phone.

                                                             9


                               ROSS
                    ...This is big -- a skein of lies
                    -- you pull at it and it just
                    keeps coming -- I'll fill you in
                    when I get home. And it's not
                    finished, either.
                        (beat)
                    They're calling it `Blackbriar'.

      As VOSEN steps out of the elevator and into his office, he
      is met by his #2, WILLS.

                               WILLS
                    We tracked the phone. Registered
                    to a London reporter named Simon
                    Ross. He works at the Guardian
                    newspaper.

                                                            10


      They enter a hallway through double doors towards the HUB.

                          VOSEN
                You tracking him?

      As they pass through, colleague hands WILLS a file.

                          WILLS
                Yeah, thanks Mike. We have a
                survey team covering him at
                work...and a sneak and peek's on
                their way to his apartment.

                          VOSEN
                Well, who talked to him? How did
                he find out about Blackbriar?

                          WILLS
                We don't know, we pulled his
                background and ran a cross check
                on any known anomalies, but we've
                come up with nothing. But, I
                think if we follow Ross, we are
                going to be able...

                         VOSEN
                Right. Ross is easy. I want the
                source.

      They enter the HUB.

                Have you heard of an Operation
                Blackbriar? I'm going to try and
                get my head around this, see you
                first thing.

      VOSEN turns.

                  want the asset put on standby,
                  just in case.

                  he's going to think before he
                  does. Every dirty little secret
                  he has. And most of all, we want

                  of his source.

      BOURNE reads The Guardian. He sees an article written by
      Simon Ross.   Title: ""RENEGADE ASSASSIN LOSE IN EUROPE"".
      It mentions BOURNE. There is a photo of Marie--

                 Sorry, a call for you.

                 We have his line, sir, but he's
                 not on it.

      WILLS looks confused.

      A CYCLE COURIER momentarily blocks its path. Looking in on

      ROSS moves to the entrance.

      Behind him, inside the tube station portico, BOURNE
      arrives.

      Sees ROSS. Sees the two survey teams. MOBILE ONE up the
      stair well and MOBILE TWO at street level.

      Commuters coming up the escalators. BOURNE joins them -
      moving towards Ross.

      Closer.

      Right on him.   ROSS oblivious.   Looking out onto the
      street.

      BOURNE brushes past him and PUTS THE PHONE IN HIS POCKET..

      ROSS feels the contact. Checking himself -- he's okay.
      But now a phone is ringing -- looks around, must be someone
      else.

      But the vibration's coming from his jacket pocket.

      ROSS takes out the phone -- not his -- puzzled.

      ROSS hits ""answer.""

      Sitting down. Checking his watch.

      ROSS shifting nervously from one foot to another.

    As all things do, it begins in the dark. EYES blink
    open. Blue eyes. The first thing they see is a WOMAN
    near 40, standing looking out a window, watching the wind
    blowing, rattling a window.

                            A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
              What are you looking at?

              The wind, Mother... They say a
              hurricane is on its way... You've
              been asleep... I was waiting to
              see you...

1   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT          1

    Now we see we're in a hospital room with layers of white
    enamel paint trying without success to hide the years...
    An old WOMAN, past 80, withered, still regal with a green
    turban around her bald head is propped by pillows, her
    blue eyes looking out at us from her bed... She's
    connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine
    drip... Her name, is DAISY FULLER. She speaks with a
    Southern lilt.

                            DAISY
              If it wasn't for hurricanes we
              wouldn't have a hurricane season.

                            CAROLINE
              I've forgotten what the weather
              can be like here. I've lived with
              four seasons so many years now.

    We see a young Black Woman, a ""caregiver,"" DOROTHY BAKER,
    in a corner, thumbing a magazine, with one eye at the
    window...

                            DOROTHY BAKER
              I saw on the news they're
              predicting trouble...

                            DAISY
              1928 they stacked people like
              firewood to close a hole in a
              levee.

    But Daisy has other things on her mind... murmuring...

                               DAISY (CONT'D)
                 It all runs together... like a
                 fingerpainting... I feel like I'm
                 on a boat, drifting...

                               CAROLINE
                      (tenderly)
                 Can I do anything for you, Mother?
                 Make anything easier?

                                DAISY
                 Hmmm. There is nothing to do,
                 Caroline. This is what it is...
                 I'm finding it harder to keep my
                 eyes open... my mouth all filled
                 with cotton...

    And agitated, feeling confined, she scratches at her
    nightgown as if it were sticking to her... she starts to take
    it off... Dorothy gets up and straightens it for her.

                               DOROTHY BAKER
                 There, there, Miss Daisy... you'll
                 scratch yourself to ribbons...
                      (to Caroline)
                 It's their way of letting go...
                      (the finality)
                 ...prob'ly today.

    Caroline is well aware of it, but the words, her
    admonition of death being so close at hand, makes
    everything even more present...

                               CAROLINE
                 Do you want more medication,
                 Mother? The doctor said you can
                 have all you want.

    Daisy is quiet, looking into the distance. Caroline,
    seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to
    cry. Daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter,
    comforting her.

                               CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                 A friend told me she never had a
                 chance to say goodbye to her
                 mother.
                      (grateful to have the
                       chance)
                 I wanted to thank you, Mother, for
                 bringing me into this world. For
                 raising me so well.

              I wanted to tell you how much
              you've meant to me. I'm going to
              miss you so much...

    They hold each other for some time... They separate...
    And there's an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk
    about... nothing left to say to each other... a hole in
    their relationship... Caroline fills it with the eternal
    question...

                            CAROLINE (CONT'D)
              Are you afraid?

                             DAISY
              Curious.   What comes next...

    She winces at some physical pain.

                            DOROTHY BAKER
              The pain's coming more steadily...
              Her breathing will falter soon...
              No need for her to suffer..

    She raises the morphine level... Daisy closes her eyes...
    drifting with the morphine... and a thought, a dream, a
    sound, crosses her mind... and she says...

                            DAISY
              They built that train station in
              1918. Your father was there the
              day it opened... He said a tuba
              band was playing...Oom-pah-pah...

2   EXT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918         2

    And we see a TUBA BAND is playing while a ribbon cutting
    ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new
    TRAIN STATION...

                            DAISY
              Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah...The
              finest clockmaker in all of the
              South built that clock...

3   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917           3

    We see an old French Quarter storefront with an endless
    array of clocks and watches...

                            DAISY'S (V.O.)
              His name was Mr. Gateau. Mr.
              Cake.

                                                                3A.



4   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       4

    The slightest of smiles crosses Daisy's lips... saying to
    herself again... ""Mr. Cake...""

5   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       5

    We see a diminutive man in a frock coat with small,
    delicate hands, ""Mr. Cake,"" working in his downstairs
    workshop. More than a few clocks stroke midnight, a
    handsome Creole Woman comes into the workshop...




                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                                   4.

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 He was married to a Creole of
                 Evangeline Parish and they had a
                 son.

    Taking his arm, she helps him up to show him to his bed.

                               DAISY'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 Did I mention, Mr. Gateau was from
                 birth, absolutely blind.

6   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917              6

    ...The clockmaker his fine hands blindly working...

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 And when their son came of age,
                 like boys will do, he joined the
                 army. They saw him off at the old
                 train station.

7   EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1917                7

    An old wooden barn of a building. Their son, hugging his
    parents, getting on a flatbed train crowded with other
    soldiers, pulling away... Mr. Gateau, blindly waving his
    hat goodbye to his son...

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 Oh how he worked, for months he
                 did nothing but work on the clock
                 for the great train station.

8   INT. WORKSHOP BELOW THE CLOCKMAKER'S HOME - NIGHT, 1918        8

    The sound of clocks constant ticking. Mr. Gateau at
    work...

                               DAISY'S (V.O.)
                 One day a letter came...

    Blanche comes into the workshop... a letter in her
    hand... She reads to her blind husband...

                               BLANCHE DEVEREUX
                 ""I am sorry to inform you that
                 your son was killed fighting for
                 his country, at the battle of the
                 Marne. In the death of Sgt.
                 Martin Gateau I lose one of my
                 most trusted men.

                                BLANCHE DEVEREUX (CONT'D)
                  When I informed members of our
                  company he had fallen, on every
                  face could be seen the mark of
                  sorrow... ...we were in hope the
                  Lord would spare him to return
                  home together... Alas this was not
                  to be. I send along his pants,
                  shirt, cavalry pin, kerchief, and
                  haircomb.""

                                DAISY (V.O.)
                  Mr. Gateau, done for the night,
                  went up to his bed.

     Mr. Gateau, blindly feeling his way up the stairs...

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  And their son came home.

9    EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918                9

     We see ""Mr. Cake"" in his familiar hat, his wife holding
     his arm, standing among the rows of coffins.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  They buried him where the Gateau
                  family had been buried for a
                  hundred and seven years...

10   EXT. NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY, 1918                          10

     An old New Orleans cemetery, vines crawling the
     sepulchers.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  Mr. Cake went back to work on his
                  clock... laboring to finish...

11   INT. THE CLOCK WORKSHOP, NEW ORLEANS - LATE NIGHT, 1918        11

     Mr. Gateau blindly setting the last spring, closing up
     the clock back... finished at last.

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  It was a morning to remember...
                  Papa said there were people
                  everywhere...

12   INT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918            12

     And we see a large throng gathered to watch the unveiling
     of the clock. Politicians, citizens, and pickpockets
     alike...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                DAISY'S (V.O.)
                  Even Teddy Roosevelt had come.

     And we see the distinctive figure of Theodore Roosevelt,
     in overcoat and hat, the war heavy on his shoulders. We
     watch Mr. Cake, with the aid of an assistant, climbing
     the scaffolding to his clock covered by a velvet drape...
     He stands for a moment... and with a simple tug, releases
     the purple swath... People gasp at the magnificent
     clock... ""Mr. Cake"" winds the clock, which chimes a
     glorious chime... Pushed by an angel, the second-hand
     begins its eternal journey...going around... Everyone
     cheers... until they realize the clock is going the wrong
     way... traveling backwards in time... A man shouts, ""It's
     running backwards!""

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU
                  I made it this way... so that
                  perhaps, the boys who were lost in
                  the war might stand and go home
                  again...

13   EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY, 1918                                13

     And we see just that... bullets leaving mens' wounds
     sailing back into the rifles from whence they came...
     limbs, whole again... cannon balls rocketing backwards
     into the cannons' breech... Fallen come to their feet, to
     live and breathe again.

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU (V.O.)
                  ... home to farm, to work, have
                  children, to live long, full
                  lives...

14   INT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918         14

     Teddy Roosevelt, bereft, removes his hat...

                                MONSIEUR GATEAU
                  Perhaps, my own son might come
                  home again...

15   EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, ANOTHER TIME     15

     And we see his own son, Martin, once again full of life
     hopping backward off the train to land where his journey
     started... back in the arms of his loving parents...

                                                                  7.



16   INT. TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918                  16

                             MONSIEUR GATEAU
               I'm sorry if I offended anybody. I
               hope you enjoy my clock.

     And his wife holding his arm, he makes his way across the
     terminal and exits... The crowd is motionless. They look
     to Teddy Roosevelt for guidance... but he simply puts his
     hat on, and with his guardians, is gone...

                             DAISY'S (V.O.)
               Mr Cake was never seen again.
               Some say he died of a broken
               heart. Some say he went to sea...

17   EXT. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - AT THE END OF A DAY             17

     Mr. Gateau, blindly rowing... away...

18   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT           18

                             DAISY
               He just rowed...rowed...away...

     The wind loudly rattles the window...they turn to look...

                              DOROTHY BAKER
               Do you mind if I make myself a
               call? I've got somebody watching
               my little boy.

                             CAROLINE
               No, please go call...

     It's quiet, Caroline sitting on the bed with her dying
     mother... with the wind knocking at the window... After
     some moments:

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               I hope I haven't disappointed you,
               Mother.

                              DAISY
               Oh honey, you could never
               disappoint me.

                             CAROLINE
               I wished I had more to show for
               myself. I know you would have
               liked to have had grandchildren.

                  What's normal?     A hat full of

                                   CAROLINE
                  What?

                  An envelope?

     Caroline doing what she's asked goes over to one of the
     suitcases by the bed... She opens it... and among the
     clothes and the keepsakes, there is indeed an old
     envelope.

                                   CAROLINE (CONT'D)
                  This one?

                                   DAISY
                  Read it to me.

     Daisy closes her eyes... Caroline takes out a sheath of
     papers... It's a journal of some kind written in
     longhand... Pages have come undone... scraps of paper,
     even some napkins...

     And for her mother's sake she begins to read it... with
     no particular interest, like reading to someone a
     selection from a menu's choices...

                             CAROLINE
               It's dated ""April 4, 1985."" It

     She's interested. She looks over at her mother.    But her
     mother's eyes are closed...

               The war to end all wars had ended.

     We see the streets of New Orleans are filled with
     drunken, singing revelers... cars jamming the
     cobblestones, people kissing, shouting joyful... Another
     burst of fireworks.

                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I was told it was an especially
               good night to be born...

                                                                9A.

     And we see in the fireworks' light, a young MAN in his
     early 30s, THOMAS BUTTON, running up to the gate of a
     fashionable town home. He nearly collides with a PRIEST
     who arrives there at the same time. Thomas runs past
     him, up the steps...

20   INT. BUTTON HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918                20

     ...He runs past a solemn Maid and up a long staircase...
     barging into the MASTER BEDROOM...

                                                                    10.



21   INT. MASTER BEDROOM, BUTTON HOUSE - NIGHT 1918                 21

     ... where we see a young Woman is lying on a bloody bed,
     frantically being administered to by a DOCTOR with the
     help of the small domestic staff... the PRIEST enters...

                             THOMAS BUTTON
                    (seeing him)
               Why are you here?

                             THE DOCTOR
               Thomas, I'm afraid she's not going
               to survive...

     And the Priest bends to say last rites over the pretty
     young woman... and the maids, bringing bedsheets,
     futilely start to change her bloody linens...

                             THOMAS BUTTON
               That's enough...! All of you!

     They move out of the way... and Thomas kneels beside his
     wife... She's pale white, fear in her soft brown eyes...
     He takes her hand...

                             THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
               I came as quickly as I could...
               I'm sorry I took so long, the
               streets are filled with people...

     As if to underscore it, fireworks go off...

                             THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D)
               You are going to be alright, my
               dearest darling... I will not let
               anything happen to you...

                             HIS YOUNG WIFE
               Promise me, Thomas...

     And she is interrupted by the sudden CRY OF A BABY.    But
     Thomas can't take his eyes from his dying wife...

                             HIS YOUNG WIFE (CONT'D)
               Promise me, he has a place...

     He doesn't understand... She looks up at him... holds his
     hand tight... then she slips away... The Doctor listening
     for her pulse... He covers her... it's quiet... the
     Priest's murmured incantations... the housemaids
     crying...



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                 11.

21   CONTINUED:                                                  21

                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)
                  She gave her life for me... And
                  for that I am forever grateful...

     Thomas, still holding her hand, is unable to let go...
     When we hear again the BABY CRYING... The BABY'S CRY is
     not quite right... It is not an infant's cry for succor,
     or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs... It's a
     deep, haunting cry from some primal soul... They all
     turn, and the room stills... listening as The BABY
     continues its mournful WAIL. Only Thomas goes to
     answer... The Baby in a basket, swaddled in a thick
     blanket, its face covered with cloth... Thomas goes to
     lift it, to see his son's face...

                                   MAID
                  Mr. Button...!

     He lifts the cloth anyway... He recoils... for he has
     seen some kind of horror... He makes the smallest of
     sounds, a whispered ""Ohhhh."" And then he suddenly
     snatches up the swaddled baby -- running with it out of
     the room... downstairs... outside...

22   EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918                              22

     ... Thomas, tears on his face, carrying his CRYING BABY,
     through the streets... Pushing through crowds...

23   EXT. A BRIDGE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918                    23

     ... he comes along an old bridge over a waterway... the
     air heavy with the haze of fireworks... the water dark...
     brokenhearted, he lifts the baby to throw it into the
     black water... He is just at the apex of this throw when,
     despite his sadness, he can't bring himself to do it...
     Instead, cradles the newborn...

                                THOMAS
                  I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

     A LANTERN lights his face... A POLICEMAN down the way...

                                POLICEMAN
                  What are you doing there!?

     The BABY starts to CRY...

                                POLICEMAN (CONT'D)
                  What do you have there?

     Thomas takes off... the Policeman after him... Thomas,
     carrying the CRYING BABY, running...

                                                                  12.



23A   EXT. NEW ORLEANS, GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT, 1918             23A

      Thomas, scuttling with the crying infant through narrow
      streets past the back porches and the back stairs of the
      large old moldering antebellum houses...

24    EXT. THE BACK OF AN OLD NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT, 1918     24

      He comes to an old three-story house with a screened
      porch, VOICES from inside... PEOPLE TALKING and
      LAUGHING... The Baby, soothed by the soft yellow light,
      by the music of the voices, by the house itself -- stops
      its mournful cry. Thomas stops, catching his breath...
      He looks in through the back porch... the sounds of
      VOICES coming... Thomas quietly sets the baby on the back
      porch steps. He takes out every last dollar he has,
      tucking the money inside the Baby's blanket... We can
      just see the figures of two people coming from inside...
      Thomas knocks on the weathered screen door... And his
      decision made, he turns, moving away from the house,
      leaving his child behind.

                              A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                I could've sworn I heard somebody
                knockin'...

      When a young Black Woman, in a green dress, comes onto
      the porch... A thin, attractive woman, in her late 20s,
      with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer -- She's known as
      QUEENIE. She's followed by a handsome Black man, MR.
      WEATHERS -- that everyone calls TIZZY. She looks out the
      door, and not seeing anything...

                                 QUEENIE
                I guess not...

      She stands for a moment taking in the night air...

                              QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                The air smells sweet...

      And she sings to herself... a song from the time...

                              TIZZY
                You look very handsome tonight,
                Ms. Queenie, handsome as I ever
                seen you... The green matches
                your eyes...

                              QUEENIE
                     (fingering dress)
                It isn't everyday a war's over,
                Mr. Weathers...

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  We have to mark it somehow... You
                  ain't no slouch yourself.

     He smiles, tips his hat... And they stand in the quiet...

                                TIZZY
                  Hambert's back in town... came
                  home legless, but he home... we're
                  gonna throw a party for him...
                  help get himself situated...
                       (beat)
                  I know you was sweet on him one
                  time...

                                QUEENIE
                  Sweeter than I shoulda been...
                  Lost his legs you say? ""You never
                  know what's comin' for you.""

     And if right on cue an older white Woman sticks her head
     out...

                                OLD WOMAN
                  Ms. Simone messed herself...

                                QUEENIE
                  She got to stop doing that, or
                  it's diapers for her... I'll be
                  right there, Mrs. Jameson...

     The woman disappears inside.    Queenie, not anxious to
     go...

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
                  It sure is nice out here, Mr.
                  Weathers...

                                TIZZY
                  Awful nice, Ms. Queenie... Come
                  out back for a moment... take your
                  mind away from things...

     He pushes open the porch screen door...

                                QUEENIE
                       (smiles)
                  Just a moment's time...

     He offers her his hand... She takes it... He backs out of
     the house, holding her hand, and he suddenly steps right
     on top of the Baby... The baby wails, Tizzy stumbles,
     nearly falls...


                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 14.

24   CONTINUED: (2)                                              24

                             TIZZY
               What in God's name...?!!

                                QUEENIE
               What is that?     A fish crawl out of
               the river...?

     She moves to it... pushes aside the blanket, and freezes.

                                QUEENIE (CONT'D)
               God in heaven!

     IT IS THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE BABY. What we
     see is the prominent bald head of any newborn... but it
     has the face, the wrinkled skin, the faded eyes, of an
     octogenarian. Indeed, if we didn't know any better, it
     would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad-eyed
     old man...

                             QUEENIE (CONT'D)
               My Goodness, the Lord did
               something here...!

                             TIZZY
               Look like a milk wagon run over
               it... three times... and back...

     And they're both motionless, not quite sure what to do...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               I didn't see it layin' there... I
               hope I didn't hurt it none...
               steppin' on it like that...

     The BABY won't stop its mournful cry...

                             TIZZY (CONT'D)
               We best leave it to the police...
               I'll go --

     Queenie hesitates... a longing.

                             QUEENIE
               It's for sure nobody wanted to
               keep it...

     And making up her mind, she suddenly grabs up the crying
     baby, taking it inside... Tizzy, anxiously whispering
     something, going in after her...

                                                                  15.



25   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918              25

     A piano's playing a standard, people singing.... There's
     a myriad of old dark rooms... heavy furniture and
     carpets... an eclectic mixture of the possessions of
     those who have lived and died here over many years... and
     we see a parlor is crowded with Old People, from sixty to
     ninety-five, in various stages of health... various
     contraptions to keep them ""afloat"". An Old Age Home. We
     see Queenie moving quietly along a hallway, carrying the
     crying baby so as not to be seen. Tizzy, following her,
     still anxiously whispering after her...

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
               Where are you, Queenie...?

                             QUEENIE
               Hold your water...
                    (and to Tizzy)
               Go see to them.

     He does what she asks. She hurries the baby into a small
     room, literally like a mouse house, under the stairs...

26   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM, OLD HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918     26

     A small room tucked under the staircase...

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
               Queenie Apple... she went and
               messed herself all over again...

                             QUEENIE
               Jane Childress start her a bath...
               and mind your business, Mrs.
               Duprey... You'll be messing
               yourself soon enough too!

     There's a KNOCK on Queenie's door.

                             A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
                    (whispers)
               Somebody stole my necklace...

                             QUEENIE
               I'll be right with you, Mrs.
               Hollister...

     She whispers to The Baby, soothing it. And looking for a
     place to put it, she opens a dresser drawer...

          CHILDREN are playing under a cluster of date palms, part of a
          small desert commune somewhere in the Middle East. Their
          MOTHERS, veiled in black, gather and talk. Bearded, turbaned

          have no independent intel verifying it's

          No one dissents. Callister picks up:

          CALLISTER (CONT'D)
          Mr. President, we have.a.51% identity
          match on Majid Al-Khoei. There is some
          possibility he's at a funeral, but we
          don't know. Regardless, counsel thinks
          we can claim 'Overriding Legal
          Authority.' Also, you should be aware we
          have an abort recommendation, but your
          cabinet, the Speaker, the Joint Chiefs
          urge a 'go.'

          THE PRESIDENT (V.0.)
          You left yourself out of the lineup.
          Callister pauses. AS THE MESSAGE ON THE MONITOR STARTS

          BLINKING: ""ABORT, ABORT, ABORT...""

          CALLISTER
          Yessir... we gauge our strategy by two
          standards: the highest probability of
          success with the least amount of
          collateral damage. At 51% probability,
          we don't have either one.

          GENERAL THOMPSON
          And if it is Al-Khoei and he walks, Sir,
          we're putting our people at risk.
          There's a long silence as the President considers.

           So Jerry makes his move, which we see is SLAMMING down a PLAYING
           CARD representing a group of DWARVES. He sits across from
          KWAME, 17. They're playing a geeky role-playing CARD and DICE

          wearing makeup?

          Oh yeah it is, dude!
          She heads out as Jerry collects the cash. Kwame puts on his own
          smock as Jerry offers him a quick lesson:

          this kid's off to a bright future. But not Jerry.

          JERRY
          That -- wow. Good for you. So it's your
          last night. You're gonna spend it
          collating.

          And JERRY, with a SKETCH PAD in his lap. A surprisingly good
          pencil rendering of the face of a LARGE DOG -- weird, but he's
          got talent. The TV disturbs his concentration -- news footage

          An ATM CARD gets slid into the slot. Jerry looks up. THE ATM

          A DOOR OPENS: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI, Jerry's elderly Polish landlady.
          Pleased to see him, but painfully annoyed to know what's coming:

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Jerry.

          JERRY
          Whatever are you cooking right now? Is

          CLOSE ON Jerry pushing a THUMB TAC into the dog sketch we saw
          him doing on the subway. PULL BACK to reveal about 25 other
          sketches on the wall. All of the same dog. The actual DOG,

          Yes. Is good -- rent is better.
          She puts a bowl of STEW into Jerry's hands.

          Unless, you know, you insist.
          He sits at the table, starts eating. This is their routine.

          Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador. But
          he believe... he is terrier. So is
          Labrador... but no labrador.
          Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann. Quietly:

          JERRY
          why do you think that is?
          As she pours a drink into a plastic cup --

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI
          Perhaps many things. When I rescue
          Johann from pound, they say he was abuse.

          Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again -- as his CELL PHONE RINGS.
          He looks at his phone, freezing. Mrs. Wierzbowski notices.

          MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D)
          Is the girl? Answer. Tell her you'. are
          Labrador. Then ask if she give you money
          for rent.
          But we've PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the
          phone. Something's affecting him deeply. He says, quietly:

          JERRY
          its my mother.

          Jerry steps outside as the phone keeps RINGING, debating: WHAT

          MOURNERS are gathering in their somber best, shaking hands.
          Across the street, we find Jerry, getting out of a taxi.
          Standing in a rumpled suit. Grim; the last thing he wants to do
          is enter that church. It's almost as if he can't. Finally,
          from somewhere, strength. He walks forward.

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 11.

          INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

          Jerry heads down the aisle, painfully self-conscious. Most of
          the MOURNERS are in the pews, turning to look at him as he
          passes. When suddenly there's a SCREAM OF TERROR -- and Jerry
          BRACES as if he was expecting it -- looks over at a WOMAN
          pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she collapses --
          Jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him--

          JERRY
          -- no! I-- I'm not him!
          All eyes on him. His voice, sad, heartbroken:

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          It's okay! I'm not Paul!
          Locks eyes with his MOTHER and FATHER up in the front pew.
          Their eyes red from crying, withered shells. And Jerry gives a
          lame wave before heading reluctantly up to the COFFIN.
          Devastated, he leans in -- and we MOVE AROUND to see the body:
          And it's fucking HIM -- Jerry's very own face, but one that
          seems to have been RECONSTRUCTED after some kind of accident.
          Gruesome and handsome all at once. This was PAUL SHAW. Jerry's
          identical twin. Off the surreal moment...
          A reverbed TRUMPET PLAYS, the tune familiar. In fact, it's:

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, booming from a trumpet played by an 8 year-
          old boy: KYLE HOLLOMAN. A WOMAN blurs into frame: RACHEL
          HOLLOMAN, searching for car keys. 28, smart, beautiful, but
          fiercely independent, she's a single mom who's taken life's
          knocks. Never as cool-headed as she wants to be, she's on a
          short fuse with everyone but Kyle, whom she adores:

          RACHEL
          Okayokay... okay: we came home, put down
          the leftovers, you turned on the TV, I
          went over, I said no TV--
          She turns to the TV area and walks straight INTO a table. Stuns
          her, momentarily, but she doesn't break stride --

          KYLE
          -- we're gonna be late, huh?

          RACHEL
          -- absolutely not -- I turned it off,
          came over here, checked messages, put the
          leftovers in the--

          CONTINUED:

          KYLE RACHEL
          --knocked over the phone-- --right, knocked over the
          phone, put it back, put the
          food in the fridge--
          She opens the fridge: HER KEYS sit atop a Tupperware container.
          Kyle hits a high note and we SLAM TO:

          INT. RACHEL'S CAR - MORNING

          The KEY turning in the ignition of a crappy, old Honda. The
          engine CHOKES, SPUTTERS. Rachel's tense--

          RACHEL
          we need to get a new car --

          KYLE
          I like your car. We're gonna be late.
          The engine still SPLIT-SPUT-SPUTTERING.::.. a BUS. whizzes by, slows
          up ahead at a bus stop. Rachel gives up, jumps out:

          RACHEL
          No we're not: the bus.

          KYLE
          -- are you kidding?

          EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

          Rachel and Kyle HAUL ASS toward the bus stop, both struggling
          with Kyle's carry-on, a.garment bag, her purse, and a trumpet
          case marked with STICKERS (Green Bay Packers among them)--

          RACHEL
          I put vitamins in your toiletry bag,
          don't forget to take two in the morning --

          KYLE
          and one at night, I know --

          RACHEL
          And your inhaler, which I may need to use
          now, is in the outside pocket -- wait!
          They rush back to a MAILBOX, she pulls bills from her purse:

          KYLE
          More bills?

          RACHEL
          Yup -- that's what happens when you have
          a kid on lay-away.
          They smile at each other. When SUDDENLY a BUS ROARS PAST the
          WIND GUSTS and the bills go FLYING into traffic:

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 13

          CONTINUED:

          RACHEL (CONT'D)

          OH, SHIT! STAY HERE!
          Rachel waves her arms at oncoming cars, runs INTO TRAFFIC--

          KYLE

          YOU SWORE!!
          As she chases the bills, SCREECHING and HONKING around her:

          RACHEL

          I KNOW, I'M SORRY!
          (Porsche HONKS as it

          PASSES)

          HEY, A LITTLE COMMON COURTESY, ASSHOLE!
          And she runs back to Kyle, THROWS the bills in the mailbox --

          KYLE
          You swore again. Was that our bus?
          Rachel looks: PAN to across the street, the bus is now LEAVING
          THE BUS STOP. PAN back to Rachel: SHIT!!

          RACHEL:
          Okay, now were gonna.be late.
          She puts fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES HARD for a cab --

          INT. TRAIN STATION - WISCONSIN - DAY

          A CLASS OF MUSIC STUDENTS boards and Amtrak train. Rachel and
          Kyle are RUNNING through the crowd toward them --

          RACHEL
          Scuze us, coming through, sorry -- WAIT!!

          WAIT!!
          Finally they arrive. Kyle's teacher, MRS. MILLER, smiles:

          MRS. MILLER
          Under the wire --

          RACHEL
          (gulping breaths)
          Hi -- sorry -- Rachel Holloman, we met--

          MRS. MILLER
          -- of course, Barbara Miller.
          (looks at watch)
          You should probably --
          And Rachel's stomach drops. Knows they've been racing towards
          this moment all morning but still not willing to accept it.
          Turning Kyle to face her --

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 14.

          CONTINUED:

          RACHEL
          Okay. Now. I want you to have an
          awesome time --

          KYLE
          I will, mom --

          RACHEL
          -- you can eat junk food, just remember
          to brush your teeth; and if you're gonna
          goof off, just be really smart about it;
          and try not to stay up past your bedtime,
          you get really cranky when you do that'--
          (turns to Mrs. Miller)
           He gets very contrarian if he doesn't get
          at least eight --

          MRS. MILLER
          I'm afraid it's time to board, Mrs.
          Holloman.
          Tears springing to Rachel's eyes. She tries to hide them.
          Bending down to be eye to eye with her son. Sotto --

          RACHEL
          You see all these kids? They're all
          calling their mothers. You just do it
          more --

          KYLE
          It's only two days,: mom. Y'know... you
          could try and some have fun too, wouldn't
          kill ya..

          RACHEL
          Fun? What's that?
           (hugging him)
           I love you so much, baby.You're my
           everything. Rock the house.

           KYLE
          -- love you too --
          They separate -- she watches as Kyle boards with Mrs. Miller:

           RACHEL
          Call me!

          MRS. MILLER
          Your mom gonna be okay?

          KYLE
          It's unclear.
          As they head into the train, Rachel steels herself and GOES.
          Passing the BAGGAGE AREA...

          CONTINUED: (2)
          We HOLD as the PORTER places Kyle's TRUMPET CASE on a conveyor
          belt. Oddly, it's ELECTRONICALLY REDIRECTED AWAY FROM THE OTHER
          INSTRUMENTS -- down a separate belt, where it emerges in a pick-
          up turnstile. Its lifted off the track by...
          A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN. Nervous. Really nervous. And the
          strangest thing -- he touches his ear and MURMURS something in
          Tajiki. To no one. Like a crazy person. What the hell?
          Walks to the curb where his white van idles. On the side is a
          decal: ""HASSAD DRY CLEANERS."" Loads the trumpet inside as we:

          INT. SHAW HOME - AFTERNOON

          Solemn quiet. Mourners talking in hushed tones. A buffet. Old
          people. Children. And over these shots, WHISPERED VOICES:

          WOMAN #1 (V.O.)
          you didn't know either?

          WOMAN #2 (V.0.)
          No idea.

          WOMAN #3 (V.0.)
          I knew he had a brother. But not a twin,
          that was...

          WOMAN.#1 (V.0.)
          I know, I know...
          Four WOMEN sit together. Heartbroken, unsettled. One glances
          across into a sitting room, where Jerry sits alone on a sofa.
          We're CLOSE on Jerry now. Holding a glass, etched with hearts.
          Looking at it as if it means something. Somehow, his childhood.
          He looks up at the stairs, as if knowing he needs to go up
          there. So he does. We MOVE with him:

          WOMAN #1 (CCNT'D)
          when was the last time they saw him?

          WOMAN #2
          Margaret said years...

          INT. SHAW HOUSE - PAUL AND JERRY'S ROOM - DAY

          TROPHIES. RIBBONS. All of them awarded to PAUL SHAW. TIGHT on
          Jerry's face as he scans the shelves of evidence. Evidence that
          he had a brother. A superior brother. Again and again we see:
          PAUL SHAW. PAUL SHAW. PAUL. PAUL. Then Jerry finds one
          framed CERTIFICATE. In the back. A Junior High ART PRIZE.
          Awarded to JERRY SHAW. He smiles at the fucking absurdity of it
          as a figure appears behind him...

          CONTINUED:
          It's WILLIAM. Their father. The worst day of this man's life.
          Jerry composes himself quickly. They stare for a moment.

          WILLIAM
          Six months without a boo or a bah.

          JERRY
          Didn't realize it'd been that long.

          WILLIAM
          Your mom was worried. So where were you
          this time?

          JERRY
          Nowhere.
          (then, a touch reticent)
          Singapore. Alaska for a few weeks.
          got a job for a while. On a...fishing
          boat. Met some great p-

          WILLIAM
          -- that's nice. Looks like you're really
          seeing the world.

          JERRY
          I'm trying, you know, just to --
          But William has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss.
          Jerry stands there, frozen, until William EMBRACES HIM. Jerry
          hugs him back -- tightly, grateful and starting to feel again.
          And just then, William says, quietly, through tears:

          WILLIAM
          You sound just like him.
          Jerry's eyes find a point in space. This is love by proxy. And
          now he hugs, his father in support, not unity. William pulls
          back. Takes his wallet from his pocket:

           WILLIAM (CONT'D)
           I want to give you some, uh...

           JERRY
          No. -- Dad, I'm okay. I'm doing really
          well. I promise.
          His father holds out some bills. North of two-hundred dollars.
          It's a stand-off. The question is: does Jerry have enough pride
          to reject the offer? And the answer is...

          EXT. CHICAGO STREET - ATM MACHINE - DAY

          CLOSE ON THE PIN NUMBER AGAIN, getting PUNCHED IN. Then FIND
          JERRY, exhausted from the funeral, slipping the money his father
          gave him into a deposit envelope. A glance at the SECURITY
          CAMERA. Then a BEEP makes him look at the screen.

          

          

          

          

          3/28/07 17

          CONTINUED:
           AND WE PUNCH IN TIGHTER ON JERRY, WHO STARES, STUNNED. The
          screen reads: ""BALANCE: $750,000.00""
           What the HELL? Glances back to the people behind him, they want
           him to hurry. He hits ""Cancel."" But the machine, as if
          disobeying, spits out five $100 bills--

           JERRY
           -- whoa --
           Jerry stabs cancel again. Now TEN MORE $100 bills-come out. He
           glances at the people in line, nervous--

           JERRY (CONT'D)
           -- two seconds, sorry --
          Eyes flick back to the ATM CAMERA. He covers it with his hand,
          pushes ""cancel"" again and again. But now.. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
          IN $100 BILLS HAS COME OUT, getting JAMMED' in the slot. People
          start to PEER OVER as Jerry SCRAMBLES to keep the cash from
          flying everywhere. And finally. The machine stops. He stuffs
          all the money in his pocket. Everyone's staring.

          JERRY (CONT'D)
          Big date. So... fingers crossed.
